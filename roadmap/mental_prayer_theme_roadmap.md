## 📜 Section 4 - Symphonic Template for Section Planning

🔧 Symphonic Template for Section Planning
The finalized structure of Arcs 1–29 forms the model for future journey sections. It balances doctrine, affect,
Scripture, liturgy, and mysticism in a way that shapes the whole soul. This 10-stage structure can be reused or varied
to build the long symphonic arc of the full journey.

| **IX. Eucharistic Deepening**      | Anima Christi → Mary at the Cross → Eucharistic Life          |
| **X. Final Journeying**            | Narrow Way → End of the Journey                               |

### 🧱 Design Principles for Future Sections

- Begin with charity, reverence, or identity in God
- Include at least one Marian cluster
- Include sin and mercy early or mid-way
- Embed liturgical devotions to anchor the journey in Church rhythm
- Use interior arcs to slow and deepen (e.g., Hidden Life, Simplicity)
- Close each section with mission, suffering, or eschatological themes
- Weave in Eucharistic and Christological deepening every 2–3 sections
