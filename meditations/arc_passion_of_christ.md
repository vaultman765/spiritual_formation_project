### 📜 Anchor Images and Primary Readings

| Day | Anchor Image | Primary Reading |
|-----|--------------|-----------------|
| **1** | **Christ in Gethsemane** Christ kneels beneath twisted olive trees. His face is pressed to the earth, streaked with sweat and blood. The chalice of suffering looms before Him. The disciples sleep nearby. The moonlight casts long shadows as He whispers, “Not My will, but Yours be done.” | Luke 22:39–46 |
| **2** | **Christ Bound and Tried** Judas kisses Him in the garden. Guards seize Him. He is dragged before the high priest. You see false witnesses, spittle, blows. Peter warms himself by the fire outside. A rooster crows. Jesus remains silent. | Matthew 26:47–68 |
| **3** | **The Scourging at the Pillar** Stripped and bound, Jesus stands at the pillar. The whip cracks. His back tears open. Blood runs down the stone floor. The guards mock, but He does not resist. The Lamb is prepared for sacrifice. | John 19:1 |
| **4** | **Christ Crowned with Thorns** Jesus is seated, hands bound, draped in a purple robe. A crown of twisted thorns is pressed onto His head. Blood trickles down His face. A reed is shoved into His hand like a mock scepter. Soldiers jeer and bow in sarcasm. Yet He radiates quiet majesty in their mockery. | Matthew 27:27–31 |
| **5** | **Christ Carries the Cross** Bruised and bleeding, Jesus takes up the heavy beam. The road is uneven. He stumbles. Simon of Cyrene is pulled from the crowd to help. Veronica emerges and presses a cloth to His face. He looks at her — the cloth bears His image. He continues forward, one step at a time. | Luke 23:26–31 |
| **6** | **The Crucifixion** Jesus is nailed to the wood. The Cross is raised. He hangs in silence between earth and heaven. “Father, forgive them,” He says. The sky darkens. He thirsts. He gives His mother to John. Love is poured out as blood. | John 19:17–30 |
| **7** | **The Final Surrender** Jesus breathes His last. “Father, into Your hands I commend My spirit.” The veil of the Temple is torn. The earth trembles. Those who stood near beat their breasts. The centurion says, “Truly this man was the Son of God.” | Luke 23:44–46 |
| **8** | **Mary at the Foot of the Cross** Mary stands beneath the Cross, silent. Her Son hangs above her. She does not cry aloud — her sorrow is still, total, unresisting. John is beside her. Christ says, “Behold your mother.” She receives the Church into her heart. | John 19:25–27 |
| **9** | **The Piercing of His Side** The sky has gone still. Christ’s body hangs lifeless. A soldier steps forward and thrusts a spear into His side. Blood and water pour out — not just fluid, but the birth of the Church. Mary sees it all. The silence deepens. | John 19:31–37 |
| **10** | **The Burial of Christ** The body of Jesus is taken down. Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea wrap Him in linen, anoint Him with myrrh. Mary touches His face one last time. The tomb is near. They roll the stone across the entrance. Stillness covers everything. | John 19:38–42 |
