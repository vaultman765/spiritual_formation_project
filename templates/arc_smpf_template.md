## [Theme Title] ([Total Days] Days)

### 📜 Anchor Images and Primary Readings

> 📝 REQUIRED: Include this table even if the arc has only one fixed image/reading.
> Each row defines a day range **within this arc only** — NOT global/master day numbers.
> Example: "1–3" means Days 1–3 *of this arc*, not Days 173–175 in the overall journey.

| Days     | Anchor Image Description                  | Primary Reading Source                  |
|----------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 1–3      | [e.g., The Crucified Christ (Face)]        | [e.g., 1 John 4:7–21]                   |
| 4–7      | [e.g., Jesus Washing the Feet of Disciples]| [e.g., John 13]                         |

> 🔁 For each arc-local day, insert exactly one copy of the SMPF structure defined in [`daily_smpf_template.md`](daily_smpf_template.md).
> Each block must begin with a ### heading and include all SMPF elements in the correct order:
Secondary Reading → Meditative Points → Ejaculatory Prayer → Colloquy → Resolution → Tags
> This file should contain only valid SMPF-formatted blocks — no summaries, alternate formats, or extra commentary.
