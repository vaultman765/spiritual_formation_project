**Ejaculatory Prayer:**

3. “You are a mad lover.”

**Colloquy:**  
> Jesus, You died for me while I was still far away. You didn’t wait. You didn’t hesitate. I don’t deserve this — and that is why it is love. Help me receive it with awe.

**Ejaculatory Prayer:**  
> “Jesus, You loved me first.”

**Resolution:**  
> I will meditate before a crucifix or tabernacle today and say: “You died for me — and I accept Your love.”

**Resolution:**  
> I will choose one act of sacrificial love today and offer it for someone difficult to love.
