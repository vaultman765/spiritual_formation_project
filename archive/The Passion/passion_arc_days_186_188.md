## 📜 Anchor Images and Primary Readings

| Day | Anchor Image | Primary Reading |
|-----|--------------|-----------------|
| **1** | **Christ in Gethsemane** Christ kneels beneath twisted olive trees. His face is pressed to the earth, streaked with sweat and blood. The chalice of suffering looms before Him. The disciples sleep nearby. The moonlight casts long shadows as He whispers, “Not My will, but Yours be done.” | Luke 22:39–46 |
| **2** | **Christ Bound and Tried** Judas kisses Him in the garden. Guards seize Him. He is dragged before the high priest. You see false witnesses, spittle, blows. Peter warms himself by the fire outside. A rooster crows. Jesus remains silent. | Matthew 26:47–68 |
| **3** | **The Scourging at the Pillar** Stripped and bound, Jesus stands at the pillar. The whip cracks. His back tears open. Blood runs down the stone floor. The guards mock, but He does not resist. The Lamb is prepared for sacrifice. | John 19:1 |

## 🕯️ Day 1: Christ in Gethsemane – Agony of Surrender

**Secondary Reading:**  
[CCC 612–613](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1O.HTM)

**Tags:** Passion, obedience, trust, suffering, Lent, silence

### 🎯 Meditative Points

1. He sees every sin — and chooses to drink the cup anyway.  
2. He asks the Father if it may pass — but surrenders.  
3. He finds His disciples asleep — and prays alone.

### 🗣️ Colloquy  

Jesus, I have fled from hard things too quickly. But You did not flee the Garden... Make my fear a prayer — and my surrender a love song.

### 💬 Ejaculatory Prayer  

**Jesus in Gethsemane, strengthen my weak will with Your agony.**

### 🔨 Resolution  

Today I will offer one hidden act of surrender — unspoken, quiet, and done for love — saying interiorly: “Not my will, but Yours be done.”

## 🕯️ Day 2: Christ Bound and Tried – The Silent Lamb

**Secondary Readings:**  
[St. Augustine, *Tractate on John - 112*](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1701112.htm)  
[CCC 595–598](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1O.HTM)

**Tags:** betrayal, silence, injustice, patience, mercy, Lent

### 🎯 Meditative Points

1. Judas betrays Him with a kiss — and Christ still calls him "friend."  
2. False witnesses rise — and He speaks not a word in defense.  
3. Peter denies Him — and He turns and looks at him with love.

### 🗣️ Colloquy  

Jesus, You endured every insult, lie, and abandonment — without retaliation. Teach me to bear small wrongs without lashing out. Let me stay close by the fire and not deny You.

### 💬 Ejaculatory Prayer  

**Jesus, silent before Your accusers, speak peace into my unrest.**

### 🔨 Resolution  

Today I will choose not to defend myself in one moment of misunderstanding — and instead offer it in reparation for betrayal.

## 🕯️ Day 3: The Scourging – Wounded for Our Healing

**Secondary Readings:**  
[St. Alphonsus Liguori, *The Passion and Death of Jesus Christ*, Ch. 2](https://www.saintsbooks.net/books/St.%20Alphonsus%20Maria%20de%20Liguori%20-%20The%20Passion%20and%20the%20Death%20of%20Jesus%20Christ.pdf)  
[CCC 572–574](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1M.HTM)

**Tags:** suffering, purity, mercy, sacrifice, Lent, Passion

### 🎯 Meditative Points

1. Every lash He endured was for love — not vengeance.  
2. His silence was more powerful than protest.  
3. By His wounds, I am healed — but do I let those wounds touch me?

### 🗣️ Colloquy  

Jesus, the blood at the pillar was mine — and You offered it freely. Let me not run from sacrifice, but find healing where You were torn.

### 💬 Ejaculatory Prayer  

**O Jesus, scourged and silent, cleanse my heart in Your blood.**

### 🔨 Resolution  

Today I will resist one temptation to self-indulgence — and unite it to Your suffering.
