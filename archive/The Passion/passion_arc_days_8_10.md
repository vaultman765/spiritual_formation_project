## Days 8–10

### 📜 Anchor Images and Primary Readings (Days 8–10)

| Day | Anchor Image | Primary Reading |
|-----|--------------|-----------------|
| **Day 8** | **Mary at the Foot of the Cross** Mary stands beneath the Cross, silent. Her Son hangs above her. She does not cry aloud — her sorrow is still, total, unresisting. John is beside her. Christ says, “Behold your mother.” She receives the Church into her heart. | John 19:25–27 |
| **Day 9** | **The Piercing of His Side** The sky has gone still. Christ’s body hangs lifeless. A soldier steps forward and thrusts a spear into His side. Blood and water pour out — not just fluid, but the birth of the Church. Mary sees it all. The silence deepens. | John 19:31–37 |
| **Day 10** | **The Burial of Christ** The body of Jesus is taken down. Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea wrap Him in linen, anoint Him with myrrh. Mary touches His face one last time. The tomb is near. They roll the stone across the entrance. Stillness covers everything. | John 19:38–42 |
