# Passion of Christ – Events and Interior Sufferings

## 📜 Anchor Images and Primary Readings (Days 4–7)

| Day | Anchor Image | Primary Reading |
|-----|--------------|-----------------|
| **4** | **Christ Crowned with Thorns** Jesus is seated, hands bound, draped in a purple robe. A crown of twisted thorns is pressed onto His head. Blood trickles down His face. A reed is shoved into His hand like a mock scepter. Soldiers jeer and bow in sarcasm. Yet He radiates quiet majesty in their mockery. | Matthew 27:27–31 |
| **5** | **Christ Carries the Cross** Bruised and bleeding, Jesus takes up the heavy beam. The road is uneven. He stumbles. Simon of Cyrene is pulled from the crowd to help. Veronica emerges and presses a cloth to His face. He looks at her — the cloth bears His image. He continues forward, one step at a time. | Luke 23:26–31 |
| **6** | **The Crucifixion** Jesus is nailed to the wood. The Cross is raised. He hangs in silence between earth and heaven. “Father, forgive them,” He says. The sky darkens. He thirsts. He gives His mother to John. Love is poured out as blood. | John 19:17–30 |
| **7** | **The Final Surrender** Jesus breathes His last. “Father, into Your hands I commend My spirit.” The veil of the Temple is torn. The earth trembles. Those who stood near beat their breasts. The centurion says, “Truly this man was the Son of God.” | Luke 23:44–46 |

## 🕯️ Day 4: Christ Crowned with Thorns – Majesty in Mockery

**Secondary Reading:**  
St. Bernard of Clairvaux, *Song of Songs*, Sermon 61 (excerpt below)

- “The crown of thorns is the diadem of mercy. What others intended as mockery, He wore as glory.”

[CCC 440](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1F.HTM)

**Tags:** suffering, humiliation, kingship, mockery, silence, Lent

### 🎯 Meditative Points

1. Christ accepts the crown of thorns — not in wrath, but in silence.
2. The King of Heaven is mocked with earthly symbols of power.
3. Every insult He received purifies the pride in my own heart.

### 🗣️ Colloquy  

Jesus, mocked King, I often seek crowns of comfort and control. Teach me to wear the crown of thorns with You — not to be honored, but to love.

### 💬 Ejaculatory Prayer  

**Jesus, King crowned in thorns, rule in my heart.**

### 🔨 Resolution  

Today I will resist one urge to seek praise — and silently offer it as a crown of thorns.

## 🕯️ Day 5: Christ Carries the Cross – The Meeting with Veronica

**Tags:** mercy, presence, love, suffering, hidden acts, Lent

### 🎯 Meditative Points

1. Christ’s suffering is public — yet He carries it without resentment.
2. Veronica’s act was small, hidden, and deeply personal.
3. Christ gave her His image — what do I offer Him?

### 🗣️ Colloquy  

Jesus, I want to be like Veronica — not solving, not preaching, but present. Let me offer a veil, a silence, a prayer… and receive Your Face in return.

### 💬 Ejaculatory Prayer  

**O Christ bearing the Cross, impress Your image on my heart.**

### 🔨 Resolution  

Today I will console Christ by offering one quiet act of compassion — unseen, unpraised, but full of love.

## 🕯️ Day 6: The Crucifixion – Love Poured Out

**Secondary Reading:**  
[CCC 619–623](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1O.HTM)

**Tags:** sacrifice, mercy, redemption, silence, atonement, Lent

### 🎯 Meditative Points

1. Christ speaks few words — but every one is infinite.
2. “I thirst” is not just physical — it is the thirst for souls.
3. His death is not a tragedy — it is a gift freely given.

### 🗣️ Colloquy  

Jesus, You were lifted up so that I might rise. Teach me not just to mourn You, but to receive the love You poured out at Calvary.

### 💬 Ejaculatory Prayer  

**Crucified Jesus, remember me in Your mercy.**

### 🔨 Resolution  

Today I will meditate for five minutes in silence before a crucifix — not speaking, only receiving.
