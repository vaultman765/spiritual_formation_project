### 🕯️ Day 4: Love Builds Communion

**Secondary Reading:**

- [CCC 1939–1942](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P6Q.HTM)

#### 🎯 Meditative Points

1. “A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another…” (Jn 13:34)  
2. The Catechism calls charity “the soul of the Church’s unity.” (CCC 1939)  

#### 🗣️ Colloquy

Lord Jesus, You did not establish a club or a cause, but a communion. Teach me to love not in isolation, but as one who belongs to Your Body.

#### 💬 Ejaculatory Prayer

**Make me an agent of communion, Lord.**

#### 🔨 Resolution (Optional)

*Today, I will restore a relationship or reach out to someone neglected — to build love, not division.*

### 🕯️ Day 5: Love in Deed and in Truth

**Secondary Reading:**

- 1 John 3:11–18
- [CCC 1939](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P6Q.HTM)

#### 🎯 Meditative Points

1. “Let us not love in word or speech but in deed and in truth.” (1 Jn 3:18)  
   Love is not measured by intention, but by sacrifice.
2. “Even as I have loved you, you also should love one another.” (Jn 13:34)  
   Christ loved with His whole body — His hands, His voice, His wounds.
3. The Catechism speaks of structures of solidarity. I must become one: a living witness to love.

#### 🗣️ Colloquy

Jesus, let my love stop being abstract. Make it physical, specific, real — as Yours was. Teach me to love in the dust, not just in ideas.

#### 💬 Ejaculatory Prayer

**Let me love as You have loved me.**

#### 🔨 Resolution (Optional)

*Today I will choose one act of embodied charity — and do it promptly, not later.*
