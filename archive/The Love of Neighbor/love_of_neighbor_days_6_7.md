### 🕯️ Day 6: Love Is Sacrificial Service

**Secondary Reading:**

- [CCC 1825](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P66.HTM)

#### 🎯 Meditative Points

1. “If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet…” (Jn 13:14)  
   Christ does not lower Himself despite His glory — but *because* of it.
2. Love does not cling to rights. It pours itself out like water in a basin.
3. The Catechism calls this love “the form of all the virtues” (CCC 1825) — it gives life to every act.

#### 🗣️ Colloquy

Jesus, I want to follow You — but I fear the basin and the towel. Give me the joy of sacrificial love, not in words but in humble acts.

#### 💬 Ejaculatory Prayer

**Let me love by lowering myself.**

#### 🔨 Resolution (Optional)

*Today I will choose a task I usually avoid — and do it with reverence.*

### 🕯️ Day 7: Love as the Command and the Legacy

**Secondary Reading:**

- [CCC 1823](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P66.HTM)
- [CCC 2447](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P8F.HTM)

#### 🎯 Meditative Points

1. “By this all men will know that you are my disciples…” (Jn 13:35)  
   This is not a suggestion — it is the identifying mark of the Church.
2. Christ’s final command is not to go, build, or preach — but to love as He has loved.
3. To serve the poor, the suffering, and the lonely *is* to love Christ Himself (CCC 2447).

#### 🗣️ Colloquy

Lord, may the mark of my life not be cleverness or strength, but love. Let me carry Your command as my joy, not my burden.

#### 💬 Ejaculatory Prayer

**Jesus, form me in the school of Your Heart.**

#### 🔨 Resolution (Optional)

*Today I will seek out someone in need — and love them as if they were You.*
