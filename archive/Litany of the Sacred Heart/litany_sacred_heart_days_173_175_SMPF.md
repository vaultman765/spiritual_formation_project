**Christ Revealing His Sacred Heart in Glory**

You kneel before the risen Christ. His eyes are like fire and mercy. His hands are extended in blessing, and His robe gleams like light. But what draws your soul is His Heart — visible, radiant, pierced, encircled with thorns, and burning with love. It is not a wound of shame, but a throne of glory. He says nothing. He simply shows you the place where divine love became visible.

Each title of the Litany is real here. You gaze at the Heart… and see eternity.

### 🎯 Meditative Points

Heart of Jesus, so full of goodness — and I, so full of myself. Break me open where I’m closed, and make me long to do good to others without repayment, just as You do to me.

### 💬 Ejaculatory Prayer  
**Heart of Jesus, teach me to love with goodness, not pride.**

### 🔨 Resolution (Optional)
