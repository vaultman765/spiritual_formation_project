# 📘 Catholic Reading Plan – Spiritual Formation Project

Welcome to the `reading_plan/` directory of the **Spiritual Formation Project**.  
This living library accompanies the journey of Catholic spiritual growth through a carefully structured multi-year reading plan.

---

## 🔁 Structure

The plan is divided into **three stages** that mirror the classical path of the interior life:

1. **Purification** *(Purgative Way)* – Conversion, detachment, virtue
2. **Illumination** *(Illuminative Way)* – Doctrine, Scripture, liturgy, deeper prayer
3. **Union** *(Unitive Way)* – Mysticism, advanced theology, spiritual marriage

Each stage is organized into a tier file:

- `tier_1_reading_plan_purification.md` ✅
- `tier_2_illumination.md` *(coming soon)*
- `tier_3_union.md` *(planned)*

---

## 🧭 Tag Integration

Each book is tagged using a shared system with the mental prayer meditations:

- `thematic:` e.g. `redemptive_suffering`, `divine_mercy`
- `virtue:` e.g. `humility`, `trust`
- `doctrinal:` e.g. `trinity`, `eucharist`
- `typological:` e.g. `paschal_lamb`, `ark_of_the_covenant`
- `mystical:` e.g. `dark_night`, `union_with_god`
- `liturgical:` e.g. `sacred_heart`, `advent`
- `structural:` e.g. `purification`, `illumination`, `union`

These tags will support:

- 📚 Thematic book recommendations inside meditations
- 🔎 Filter/search functionality on the future website
- 🔄 Book-to-arc mapping for seamless spiritual integration

## 🏗️ How to Use This Folder

- Read the tiers in order — or jump in based on your current spiritual state
- Files are Markdown (`.md`) for easy versioning and website integration
- Each book is placed intentionally by spiritual fruitfulness, not difficulty

> 💡 This directory is designed to evolve. It will grow alongside the prayer plan and the website.

---

## 🌱 Future Expansions

- `literary_arc.md` – Catholic novels, cultural works, poetic reflections
- `theme_bundles.md` – E.g., Marian Bundle, Typology Set, Suffering & Trust Pathway
- `book_index.yaml` – Structured metadata file for each book
