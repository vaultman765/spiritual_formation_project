# üïØÔ∏è Spiritual Formation Project ‚Äì Catholic Mental Prayer Journey

This repository contains a longform, deeply-structured spiritual formation journey grounded in the tradition of **Catholic mental prayer**, using a format inspired by **St. Ignatius**, **St. Teresa of Avila**, and the **saints of the Church**. It blends **Scripture**, **magisterial texts**, **Church Fathers**, and **Catholic theology** into daily meditations that follow a thematic arc-based structure.

> ‚ÄúSpeak, Lord, for Your servant is listening.‚Äù (1 Samuel 3:10)

## ‚úçÔ∏è Format Reference ‚Äì SMPF Standard

Every meditation in this project follows the **Structured Mental Prayer Format (SMPF)**:

- **Anchor Image** ‚Äì Rooted composition to guide imaginative prayer  
- **Primary Reading** ‚Äì Fixed per arc (Scripture or magisterial text)  
- **Secondary Reading** ‚Äì Varies per day (CCC, Saints, Papal texts, etc.)  
- **1‚Äì3 Meditative Points** ‚Äì Narrow focus drawn from readings  
- **Colloquy** ‚Äì Personal prayer with Jesus, Mary, or the Father  
- **Ejaculatory Prayer** ‚Äì Short aspiration
- **Resolution** ‚Äì Specific, practical action for the day (optional - or make your own)

See the following canonical arcs as structural examples:

- [`arc_litany_sacred_heart.md`](meditations/arc_litany_sacred_heart.md)
- [`arc_passion_of_christ.md`](meditations/arc_passion_of_christ.md)

## üìö Catholic Reading Plan

This repository also contains a **long-term Catholic reading plan** to accompany and enrich the mental prayer journey.

Books are organized not by date, but by:

- **Spiritual importance** (must-read ‚Üí advanced)
- **Thematic alignment** (Eucharist, Suffering, Mary, etc.)
- **Spiritual rhythm** (narrative, theology, prayer)

Each book is tagged with:

- Spiritual themes (e.g., holiness, trust, sacrifice)  
- Genre (e.g., Scripture, Doctrine, Biography, Mystical Theology)  
- Depth level (Introductory, Intermediate, Advanced)

Planned files:

- `reading_plan_master.md` ‚Äì Full reading flow with tiered sections
- `reading_plan_metadata.yaml` ‚Äì Tag mappings for integration with meditation themes and future site filters

## üè∑Ô∏è Tagging & Metadata

All arcs and readings are gradually being tagged with structured YAML metadata to support:

- üîç Website filtering and search  
- üìñ Theme-linked reading suggestions  
- üß† Tag-aware recommendations

See [`tag_bank_reference.yaml`](metadata/tag_bank_reference.yaml) for the living tag list.
