# 🕯️ Spiritual Formation Project – Catholic Mental Prayer Journey

This repository contains a longform, deeply-structured spiritual formation journey grounded in the tradition of **Catholic mental prayer**, using a format inspired by **St. Ignatius**, **St. Teresa of Avila**, and the **saints of the Church**. It blends **Scripture**, **magisterial texts**, **Church Fathers**, and **Catholic theology** into daily meditations that follow a thematic arc-based structure.

> “Speak, Lord, for Your servant is listening.” (1 Samuel 3:10)

## ✍️ Format Reference – SMPF Standard

Every meditation in this project follows the **Structured Mental Prayer Format (SMPF)**:

- **Anchor Image** – Rooted composition to guide imaginative prayer  
- **Primary Reading** – Fixed per arc (Scripture or magisterial text)  
- **Secondary Reading** – Varies per day (CCC, Saints, Papal texts, etc.)  
- **1–3 Meditative Points** – Narrow focus drawn from readings  
- **Colloquy** – Personal prayer with Jesus, Mary, or the Father  
- **Ejaculatory Prayer** – Short aspiration
- **Resolution** – Specific, practical action for the day (optional - or make your own)

See the following canonical arcs as structural examples:

- [`arc_litany_sacred_heart.md`](meditations/arc_litany_sacred_heart.md)
- [`arc_passion_of_christ.md`](meditations/arc_passion_of_christ.md)

## 📚 Catholic Reading Plan

This repository also contains a **long-term Catholic reading plan** to accompany and enrich the mental prayer journey.

Books are organized not by date, but by:

- **Spiritual importance** (must-read → advanced)
- **Thematic alignment** (Eucharist, Suffering, Mary, etc.)
- **Spiritual rhythm** (narrative, theology, prayer)

Each book is tagged with:

- Spiritual themes (e.g., holiness, trust, sacrifice)  
- Genre (e.g., Scripture, Doctrine, Biography, Mystical Theology)  
- Depth level (Introductory, Intermediate, Advanced)

Planned files:

- `reading_plan_master.md` – Full reading flow with tiered sections
- `reading_plan_metadata.yaml` – Tag mappings for integration with meditation themes and future site filters

---

## 🏷️ Tagging & Metadata

All arcs and readings are gradually being tagged with structured YAML metadata to support:

- 🔍 Website filtering and search  
- 📖 Theme-linked reading suggestions  
- 🧠 Tag-aware recommendations

See [`tag_bank.yaml`](metadata/tag_bank.yaml) for the living tag list.

Tag categories include:

- **Doctrinal** – Eucharist, Cross, Church  
- **Virtue** – humility, courage, purity  
- **Mystical** – dryness, union, longing  
- **Liturgical** – Lent, Easter, Feast days  
- **Structural** – litany, typology, ecclesiology
