anchor_image:
  Christ washing the disciples’ feet — The Son of God kneels in the dust.
  He touches dirt and fatigue, pouring water not only onto their feet, but into their
  shame. This is love made visible in humility.

meditative_points:
  - '"A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another." (Jn 13:34)'
  - '"By this all men will know that you are my disciples…" (Jn 13:35)
    This is not a suggestion — it is the identifying mark of the Church.'
  - Every work of mercy — spiritual or corporal — is an echo of the washing of feet.
ejaculatory_prayer: Write Your command on my heart.
colloquy:
  "Jesus, You gave no theory — You gave a command. Love. Let this be what
  defines me. Let this be how I imitate You: not in brilliance, but in mercy."
resolution: Today I will seek out someone in need — and love them as if they were You.
