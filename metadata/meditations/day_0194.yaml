anchor_image: You stand before the open tabernacle, gazing at the consecrated Host exposed in
  the monstrance. Rays of light stream from the Host, illuminating your heart and drawing you into
  the warmth of Christ's saving presence. You feel His Body, broken for you, offering refuge from
  every temptation and weakness.

meditative_points:
  - See the consecrated Host. Jesus’ Body, given up for you.
  - Feel the mystery of that Body saving you — not just symbolically, but in reality.
  - Let the words 'Body of Christ, save me' become your plea in temptation and weakness.
ejaculatory_prayer: Body of Christ, shelter and save me.
colloquy: Thank Jesus for His Incarnate Body. Speak to Him about the times you’ve
  forgotten its saving power. Beg to receive Him with deeper reverence.
resolution: I will make a spiritual communion today, uniting myself to the saving
  power of His Body.
