meditative_points:
  - "Whisper the plea: “From the fear that trusting You will leave me more destitute… Deliver me, Jesus.”"
  - Watch the birds of the air, clothed and fed — your Father knows what you need.
  - Trust does not impoverish, it enriches; surrender opens the storehouse of heaven.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, increase my trust in Your providence.
colloquy: Lord, free me from clinging to control. Teach me that letting go brings true abundance.
resolution: I will make a small sacrifice today and offer it in trust that You will provide.
