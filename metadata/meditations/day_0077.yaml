meditative_points:
  - To Jesus through Mary — this is not a sentiment, but a path
  - Her Heart is the surest way to remain in union with Christ
  - Consecration to Mary means entrusting everything — joys, wounds, and will
ejaculatory_prayer: Immaculate Heart of Mary, I am all yours.
colloquy:
  O Mary, my Mother, I entrust everything to your Immaculate Heart. Teach
  me to live hidden in you, so that I may live ever more deeply in Christ. Let nothing
  in me remain apart from you — for you belong entirely to Him.
resolution:
  I will renew my Marian consecration or make an act of entrustment today
  with intention and love.
