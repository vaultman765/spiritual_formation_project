  - "Hear St. Paul: “I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake.” Let the words stand before you at the foot of the Cross."
  - "Fix on the mystery: suffering joined to Christ becomes life for His Body, the Church."
  - See the Church beneath the Cross, receiving fruit from sacrifice."

  Teach me to offer trials with You for Your Body, the Church. Let my pain become prayer for others.
