anchor_image: You gaze upon the face of Christ — sometimes weary, sometimes joyful, sometimes in sorrow — always truly
  human, always revealing the love of God. You remain close, watching His expressions, gestures, and emotions as He
  lives among us.

meditative_points:
  - Watch Christ, tired from the journey, sit by the well at midday.
  - See His human weariness — thirsty, resting, yet still attentive to the soul before Him.
  - Recognize that His fatigue reveals His solidarity with our weakness.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, weary for me, give me rest in You.
colloquy: O Christ, even in Your weariness You sought the lost. Let me never be ashamed of my weakness but find strength in You.
resolution: I will pause in the middle of my work today to rest briefly with Christ in mind.
