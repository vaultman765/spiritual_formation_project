anchor_image:
  You stand with the Rich Man in the afterlife. The great chasm is fixed.
  Christ, radiant and merciful, sits as Judge; Abraham consoles Lazarus at his side.
  You witness the moment when all choices are revealed.

meditative_points:
  - “Between us and you a great chasm has been fixed.” The gulf is uncrossable.
  - “Son, remember…” Abraham’s words echo through eternity.
  - Lazarus is comforted; the Rich Man thirsts. One soul rests on Abraham’s heart;
    the other pleads for a single drop of water.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, Judge and Redeemer, have mercy on me.
colloquy: Speak to Christ who knows all your deeds. Entrust your soul to His mercy now, before that day arrives.
resolution: Today I will show mercy to someone in need, remembering that every act echoes in eternity.
