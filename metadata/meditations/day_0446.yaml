  - "You hear David rejoice: “Blessed is the one whose sin is forgiven.”"
  - You recall the crushing weight of unconfessed sin — “my bones wasted away” — and the freedom after absolution.
  - You stand among the faithful, called to rejoice in the Lord who surrounds with mercy.
ejaculatory_prayer: “Blessed are You, Lord, who forgive my sins.”
colloquy: Lord, You are my hiding place, preserving me from trouble. Teach me to confess quickly and trust in Your mercy always.
resolution: I will examine my conscience tonight and prepare for my next confession with honesty and trust.
