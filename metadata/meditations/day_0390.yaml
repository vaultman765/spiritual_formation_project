meditative_points:
  - "“A sower went out to sow.” Hear the seeds striking soil at your feet as His words fall on your heart."
  - "Watch the path, the rocky ground, the thorns, the deep earth — four places, one seed."
  - "Stay with the good soil: depth, moisture, patience; the word roots, grows, and bears fruit."
ejaculatory_prayer: Lord, let Your word take root in me.
colloquy: Jesus, Your word is life. Break the hardness in me, clear the stones, and quiet the thorns,
  that I may keep Your word and bear fruit for Your Kingdom.
resolution: I will read today’s Gospel aloud once slowly and keep five silent minutes afterward,
  guarding that time from every distraction.
