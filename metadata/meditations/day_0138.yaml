anchor_image: The disciples sit with Jesus at the Last Supper.
  He speaks calmly of going to prepare a place for them.
  We see His eyes — clear, steady, full of promise.
  We are seated among them, listening to the promise.

meditative_points:
  - “I go to prepare a place for you.” These are not vague comforts — they are precise, personal, and true.
    The room is ready. My name is known. The path is opened.
  - “I am the Way.” Even death becomes passable, because He walked it first.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, my Way and my Life — bring me home to the Father.
colloquy: Speak to Christ as one who walks behind Him. Thank Him for preparing your place,
  and ask Him for the grace to reach it without delay or detour.
resolution: Today I will place my trust in Jesus by naming aloud — or writing —
  one fear I surrender to His promise of eternal life.
