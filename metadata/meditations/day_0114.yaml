meditative_points:
  - “Blessed are the poor in spirit…” — Christ looks at me, not to shame, but to promise
    a kingdom.
  - Poverty of spirit - interior detachment and humble trust.
ejaculatory_prayer:
  Jesus, strip me of pride and fill me with the treasure of Your
  kingdom.
colloquy:
  Lord, You who had nowhere to lay Your head, look on my heart and remove
  all I cling to. Teach me to delight in holy poverty — to desire nothing but You.
  Let me love what You love, and let me follow where You lead, even among the lowly
  and the lepers.
resolution: Today I will give something up or go without in honor of Christ’s poverty.
