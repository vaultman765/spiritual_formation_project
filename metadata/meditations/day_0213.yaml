  “The Lord Jesus, on the night He was betrayed, took bread…” You hear the apostle proclaim the Eucharist as tradition
  handed on to the Church."

meditative_points:
  - Hear Paul solemnly hand on what he received — the words and actions of Jesus at the Supper.
  - Recognize that the Eucharist is not invention but sacred Tradition faithfully preserved.
  - "Realize that each celebration is both memorial and proclamation: “until He comes.”"
ejaculatory_prayer: Lord, may I receive Your Body with faith and fidelity.
colloquy: Jesus, I thank You for entrusting the Church with this sacred mystery.
  Keep me always faithful to the Eucharist, in belief and in practice.
resolution: I will take time today to recall the words of consecration,
  uniting myself interiorly to every Mass celebrated throughout the world.
