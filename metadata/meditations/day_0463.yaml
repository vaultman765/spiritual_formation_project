meditative_points:
  - The cross begins in the surrender of preference — the quiet “no” to self so that a deeper “yes” to God may be born.
  - Interior penance is a turning of the heart. Mortification is the reordering of love.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, teach me to prefer Your will to my own.
colloquy: Speak to Christ about the areas where you cling to control. Ask for the grace to surrender not in fear, but in trust.
resolution: Today I will willingly surrender one personal preference out of love for Christ.
