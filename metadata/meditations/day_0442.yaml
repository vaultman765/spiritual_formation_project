  chambers vanish into mystery.

meditative_points:
  - Human craft plumbs the earth; yet the fear of the Lord alone opens wisdom’s door.
  - The Name spoken in reverence becomes light where no lamp can reach.
  - The soul tastes silence where wisdom dwells—“God understands the way to it.”
ejaculatory_prayer: “Lord, teach me holy fear—the beginning of wisdom.”
colloquy: Father, I seek answers and miss You. Draw me past curiosity into worship; let your gaze become my understanding.
resolution: Read Job 28:28 slowly three times today; bow your head each time you utter “fear of the Lord.”
