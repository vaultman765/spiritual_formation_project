meditative_points:
  - “And she conceived by the Holy Spirit.”
  - The conception of Christ in Mary is the moment eternity entered time — not with
    noise, but with divine silence.
  - The Spirit who hovered over the waters now enters the womb of the Virgin to form
    the body of the Eternal Son.
ejaculatory_prayer: O Holy Spirit, overshadow my soul with Your light, as You did
  the Virgin Mary.
colloquy: O Spirit of the Living God, as You conceived Christ in the silence of Mary’s
  heart, conceive in me a greater love for Him. Let Your light overshadow my own will
  and bring forth in me the image of the Son. May I decrease, that He may increase.
resolution: Today I will pause and silently invoke the Holy Spirit before making any
  decision or judgment.
