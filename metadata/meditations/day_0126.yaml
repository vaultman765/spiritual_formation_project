meditative_points:
  - Christ is content to remain hidden for years, with no recognition.
  - He sanctifies time by remaining in silence and patience.
  - Nazareth is the furnace of humility, where glory is veiled in dust.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, hidden in Nazareth, hide me in the Father's will.
colloquy:
  Lord, You chose to remain unknown, poor, and quiet. Teach me the value of
  what the world despises. Teach me to love hiddenness. I want to be with You in the
  silence of Nazareth.
resolution:
  I will choose a hidden task today and do it with reverence, as Christ
  did.
