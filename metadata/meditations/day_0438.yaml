day_title: “If Only I Knew Where to Find Him”
anchor_image: You walk with Job along a wind-scoured path outside the city.
  He stretches his hands toward the horizon—east, west, north, south—longing to find God
  and lay out his case, confident that God knows the way he takes.

meditative_points:
  - "The ache of seeking: footsteps in dust, the sense of absence thick as heat."
  - “He knows the way that I take”—trust glows like an ember under the ash of desolation.
  - The desire to speak face-to-face becomes prayer itself, drawing the soul into honest presence.
ejaculatory_prayer: “O God, you search me and you know me.”
colloquy: Lord, when I cannot find you, find me. Turn my restless searching into steadfast communion;
  let my steps follow the path your eyes already trace.
resolution: Set ten quiet minutes today to pray with Job 23:10—repeat it slowly until one word rests in the heart.
