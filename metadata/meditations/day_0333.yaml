meditative_points:
  - "Hear the devil tempting you: “Turn these stones into bread.” It is hunger He presses on."
  - See Christ reply with Scripture — His hunger is real, but His heart is fed by the Father’s Word.
  - "Contrast Adam’s grasping at the fruit: Christ refuses the bread that is not given by God."
ejaculatory_prayer: Lord, make Your Word my food.
colloquy: Jesus, I so often seek comfort before Your will. Teach me to hunger for what truly nourishes.
  Let me live on every word that comes from the Father’s mouth.
resolution: Before meals today, I will pray slowly and recall that only God truly feeds me.
