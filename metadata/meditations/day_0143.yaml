meditative_points:
  - Mary’s mantle shields the soul from the full light of judgment. Her prayer is silent but powerful.
  - “Who is he that will condemn? Christ Jesus is He who died…” The saints’ prayers rise as incense before the throne.
  - Christ listens. Mercy and justice meet in His gaze, moved by the prayers of His friends.
ejaculatory_prayer: Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death.
colloquy: Thank Mary and your patron saints for their loving intercession. Ask to trust in their prayers when you face your own judgment.
resolution: Today I will invoke my patron saint and Our Lady by name, entrusting a personal need to their care.
