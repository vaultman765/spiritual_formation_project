meditative_points:
  - God hides Himself—partly to purify us, partly to reveal our dependence. This hiddenness can increase fear—but it is
    a fear of mystery, not absence.
  - 'Holy fear remains even in spiritual dryness. When we do not "feel" God, fear reminds us: He is still present'
  - The Spirit teaches us to love the hidden God, even when our senses fail.
ejaculatory_prayer: Even hidden, You are worthy of my reverence.
colloquy: Hidden Lord, even when I do not see You, let my soul still tremble. Teach me to walk by reverent trust, not sight.
resolution: I will practice faith in silence today when God feels absent, choosing awe over complaint.
