meditative_points:
  - "Test the spirits: does this movement lead you closer to Christ, or into subtle pride?"
  - See how consolation can be imitated by the enemy — discern the source.
  - Attend to the peace that endures when the Spirit acts, even amid trial.
ejaculatory_prayer: Lord, grant me light to discern Your voice from all others.
colloquy: Jesus, I often mistake false peace for true consolation. Purify my perception. Let me cling to You and reject the deceiver’s lies.
resolution: I will examine one recent decision in the light of these rules, asking whether it bore lasting peace or left me empty.
