meditative_points:
  - “From the belief that I have to earn Your love… Deliver me, Jesus.” Rest in the truth that His love precedes every action.
  - See yourself like a child, quieted on His breast — loved before you could speak or labor.
  - Let go of striving to prove yourself; His love is gift, not wage.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, free me from self-reliance.
colloquy: Lord, I confess how often I try to win Your favor. Teach me to live as one already beloved.
resolution: Today I will pause and whisper, “I am loved by God” before beginning a task.
