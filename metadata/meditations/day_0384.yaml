meditative_points:
  - "Hear Christ: “We will come to him and make our home with him.” The Trinity promises not only presence but indwelling."
  - The love of God is not distant but interior, a dwelling place prepared in the soul.
  - This indwelling begins where love and obedience meet.
ejaculatory_prayer: O Holy Trinity, dwell within me.
colloquy: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, I adore Your presence within.
  Teach me to love You by keeping Your word, and make my soul Your temple.
resolution: Today I will recall the presence of God within me at least three times, renewing an act of adoration.
