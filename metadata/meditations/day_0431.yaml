meditative_points:
  - Listen as Job names the fragility of man—grass withering, a flower cut down—and lets it stand before God.
  - Feel the ache of longing in “Oh, that You would hide me in Sheol” while a faint thread of hope glints in the dusk.
  - Sense wisdom emerging not from control but from truth spoken in God’s sight.
ejaculatory_prayer: Teach us to number our days, Lord.
colloquy: Father, my life is a breath in Your hands. Receive my fear of death and return it as trusting hope in Your mercy.
resolution: Pray for a happy death today—one Our Father and Hail Mary for the grace of final perseverance.
