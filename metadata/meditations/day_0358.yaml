meditative_points:
  - The Creator of the universe lies in straw, teaching by His silence the beauty of poverty embraced in love.
  - "Simplicity is revealed: nothing distracts from the Child Himself. Poverty unclutters the heart so God’s light can shine."
  - See your own clinging to comfort or recognition. Ask to be stripped of all that hides Christ.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, born poor, make my heart simple and free.
colloquy: Kneel before the manger and tell Jesus what holds your heart back from simplicity.
  Offer Him one attachment and ask for the joy of holy poverty.
resolution: Today I will embrace one inconvenience or discomfort willingly, uniting it to the poverty of Bethlehem.
