day_title: Majesty Hidden — “These Are but the Edges of His Ways”
anchor_image: Night sky deepens. Bildad speaks briefly of human smallness;
  then Job lifts his eyes and names thunder, sea, constellations—glimpses of a power that veils itself.
  The stars seem nearer as his voice softens into awe.

meditative_points:
  - "Creation becomes a temple: pillars trembling, depths bound, light wrapped in cloud."
  - “Whisper” and “thunder”—reverence grows at the edge of what can be uttered.
  - "The soul bows with Job: wonder is wisdom’s doorway."
ejaculatory_prayer: “Lord of majesty, teach my heart holy awe.”
colloquy: Almighty God, your greatness humbles my speech.
  Let awe cleanse my thoughts and make my prayer simple and true. Hide me in your power and reveal your mercy.
resolution: Spend five minutes outside under the sky today; praise God aloud with one line from Psalm 104.
