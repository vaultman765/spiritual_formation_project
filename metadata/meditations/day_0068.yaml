meditative_points:
  - 'The fire was prepared for the devil - not for man'
  - Man goes there only by refusal of love and mercy
  - Even in wrath, God is just and merciful
ejaculatory_prayer: Deliver me, Lord, from the fire of Hell.
colloquy:
  O God, how sorrowful to know that souls are lost forever. You prepared Heaven
  for us, not fire. Yet You are just. Save me by Your mercy. Help me draw others back
  before it is too late.
resolution: I will offer my next trial in reparation for those far from God.
