meditative_points:
  - Mary intercedes with Jesus.
  - Do whatever He tells you.
  - This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee… and His disciples believed
    in Him.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, transform my heart as You transformed the water.
colloquy:
  O Lord, You began Your signs at the request of Your Mother — teach me to
  trust You through her intercession. Let the wine of joy and faith flow in my life
  as it did at Cana, through Your hidden glory revealed.
resolution:
  Today I will seek to quietly intercede for someone else's need, as Mary
  did at Cana.
