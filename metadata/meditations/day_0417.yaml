meditative_points:
  - Hear the heavens themselves cry, “Bless the Lord,” as though the sky were alive in adoration.
  - See the angelic hosts joining the youths in their hymn, making the furnace a temple of praise.
  - Feel creation above you — the vast expanse — opening as a cathedral dome to magnify God’s glory.
ejaculatory_prayer: "Blessed are You, O Lord, in the firmament of heaven."
colloquy: Lord, let my heart become as wide as the heavens, so that I may never cease praising You.
resolution: Step outside and lift your eyes to the sky today — offer a doxology for God’s majesty.
