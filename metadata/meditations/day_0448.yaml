meditative_points:
  - "Listen to David’s cry: “Create in me a clean heart, O God.”"
  - You watch the sinner broken in spirit, yet confident that God will not despise his contrite heart.
  - You join David in promising to teach transgressors God’s ways after being restored.
ejaculatory_prayer: “Create in me a clean heart, O God.”
colloquy: Lord, only Your mercy can cleanse my deepest stains. Renew me, so my lips may sing Your praise again.
resolution: I will recite Psalm 51 slowly in prayer tonight, letting its words become my own.
