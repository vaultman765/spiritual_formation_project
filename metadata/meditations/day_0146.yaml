day_title: The Blood Foretold — The Passover and the Lamb
anchor_image: The night of the first Passover. In a humble Israelite home, a lamb has just been
  sacrificed; its blood is freshly painted on the doorposts. Families are gathered
  together in silent, prayerful anticipation. Candlelight flickers on faces filled
  with hope and fear, as outside, the Angel of Death passes over Egypt. The city is
  wrapped in supernatural quiet, and the blood of the lamb stands as a visible mark of
  God’s protection and promise.

meditative_points:
  - I am standing in the home of an Israelite family as the lamb is sacrificed and its blood painted on the door.
    Feel the hush, the trembling hope, and the deep awareness of God’s promise of deliverance.
  - See how God uses the blood of a lamb — humble, pure, and silent — as the means by which death is turned away.
ejaculatory_prayer: Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world, have mercy on us by Your Precious Blood.
colloquy: Speak to the Eternal Father, placing yourself beside the Israelites on that first Passover night.
  Thank Him for the immense mercy shown through the Blood of the Lamb, and ask to be marked, protected,
  and set free by the Blood of Christ in every danger and temptation.
resolution: Today, I will reflect on God’s mercy shown to the Israelites and ask to be marked by the Blood of Christ in all I do.
