meditative_points:
  - "Hear the furnace roar—and then the soft “dew” that tames it.
    Creation is not mute: mountains, rivers, beasts, and birds seem to answer the hymn, “Bless the Lord.”"
  - "Watch the three youths turn every element into praise: fire that should destroy becomes a choir loft;
    earth and sea are invited to bless God."
  - Let your own breath join the cosmic chorus—one small voice within the great liturgy of all things.
ejaculatory_prayer: Blessed are You, Lord, in all Your works.
colloquy: Creator God, let my heart never be silent when Your creation sings.
  Teach me to bless You in sun and shadow, in plenty and want.
resolution: I will step outside and speak a short “Bless the Lord” over what I see—sky,
  tree, or stone—consciously joining creation’s praise.
