day_title: A Sword Will Pierce Your Soul
anchor_image: You are standing with Mary at the foot of the Cross. She gazes upon her Son in agony, hears His words,
  and unites her heart to His sacrifice. John is beside her, and the soldiers are near. Simeon’s prophecy — that a
  sword would pierce her soul — is now fulfilled.

meditative_points:
  - See Mary’s face as Simeon’s prophecy is fulfilled — her heart pierced with sorrow.
  - Stand beside her as she suffers silently with Christ, her soul united to His sacrifice.
  - Recognize that her pain flows from love — a share in her Son’s redeeming Passion.
ejaculatory_prayer: Mary, let me remain beside you at the Cross.
colloquy: Mother, I see your pierced heart at Calvary. Help me never to flee from the Cross but to stay with you in faith and love.
resolution: I will meditate slowly on Luke 2:35 today, asking Mary to share with me her steadfast courage at the Cross.
