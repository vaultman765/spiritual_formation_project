anchor_image: Midday glare on the ash heap. Bildad stands, hands clasped behind his back,
  reciting proverbs with measured certainty as Job stares at the ground, dust drifting from his hair.

meditative_points:
  - Feel the chill of neat answers spoken over open wounds; hear wisdom become a weight on the sufferer’s chest.
  - Watch Job’s eyes refuse an easy story, keeping the deeper mystery before God.
ejaculatory_prayer: Teach me, Lord, to seek Your truth, not my own certainty.
colloquy: Jesus, spare me from judging what I cannot see.
  Give me a heart that waits with those who suffer and trusts Your hidden work.
resolution: Refrain from interpreting another’s trial today; offer intercession instead of explanation.
