anchor_image: You stand on the shore of the Sea of Galilee. Jesus is a short distance offshore in a boat, teaching the crowd.
  The water carries His voice; the sun is high; the press of people quiets as He begins to speak.

meditative_points:
  - “Everything is ready; come to the wedding.” The Kingdom is invitation before it is obligation.
  - “Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding garment?” Grace must clothe the guest.
  - Many are called—remain with the desire to be chosen in holiness.
ejaculatory_prayer: Clothe me, Lord, with Your grace.
colloquy: Bridegroom, I accept Your invitation. Give me the garment of sanctifying grace and keep me faithful at Your feast.
resolution: I will make an act of contrition today and, if needed, resolve to seek Confession promptly.
