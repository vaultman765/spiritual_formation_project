meditative_points:
  - Jesus speaks directly to you - The world calls us to hate but He calls you to love.
  - Consider the brother before you; your word can kill or reconcile.
  - The altar awaits—first be reconciled.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, make my heart meek and at peace.
colloquy: Lord, I place my resentment before You. Speak Your word into my anger and make it gentle.
resolution: I will take one concrete step toward reconciliation today - a call, an apology, or a blessing in prayer.
