meditative_points:
  - Fix on the soldier’s lance opening His side - blood and water flow.
  - See in that flow the sacraments and the birth of the Church.
  - Remain with Mary and John, witnesses of the Church’s beginning at the Cross.
ejaculatory_prayer: O Jesus, let me live from the life that flows from Your Heart.
colloquy: Lord, Your open side is my refuge and the Church’s origin. Keep me faithful within the Body born from You.
  Let my life draw strength from Your wounds.
resolution: I will recall my baptism today and make the Sign of the Cross slowly, remembering I live from Christ’s pierced side.
