meditative_points:
  - “The Angel of the Lord declared…” — the message begins with Heaven. The initiative
    belongs to God.
  - Gabriel stands in radiant clarity; Mary listens in silence.
ejaculatory_prayer: O Mary, full of grace, teach me to receive the Word of God with
  silence and awe.
colloquy: Speak, O Lord, through Your angelic messengers and sacred interruptions.
  As you did for Mary, so break into the stillness of my life with your voice and
  call. Let me not fear your approach, but treasure it with wonder. May your first
  word stir my heart before I offer any reply.
resolution: I will pause at midday today to silently recollect the presence of God
  and thank Him for His initiative in calling me.
