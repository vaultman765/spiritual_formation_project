  - He was bound and handed over to be scourged.
  - Each lash tore His flesh, yet He uttered not a word.
  - The silence of the Lamb — enduring the cruelty of men for our redemption.

colloquy:
  Speak to the suffering Christ. Ask Him what He bore for you. Tell Him you
  wish to make reparation by your love.

  Today, I will patiently bear a small annoyance or insult in reparation
  for sins of the flesh.
