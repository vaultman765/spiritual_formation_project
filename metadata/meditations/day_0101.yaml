meditative_points:
  - The Kingdom of God is at hand.
  - Repent, and believe in the Gospel.
  - Christ invites us into His reign not by force, but by mercy and love.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, reign in me — Your Kingdom come in my soul.
colloquy: Lord Jesus, proclaim again in my heart the coming of Your Kingdom. Let my
  life echo Your call to conversion, and may Your truth and mercy rule my thoughts,
  my desires, my will.
resolution: I will reflect on one way today I can extend Christ’s reign — through
  mercy, truth, or charity.
