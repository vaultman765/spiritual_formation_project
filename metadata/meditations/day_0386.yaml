meditative_points:
  - Your body and soul are consecrated as God’s dwelling; to sin against them is sacrilege.
  - The Spirit sanctifies the temple, making your very life a place of worship.
  - To live as temple means to guard purity and honor the presence within.
ejaculatory_prayer: Spirit of God, keep Your temple holy.
colloquy: Lord, forgive me for defiling what is Yours. Let me live in reverence, remembering that I carry You within me at all times.
resolution: I will treat my body with reverence today,
  making one concrete choice of purity or self-discipline in honor of the Spirit’s dwelling.
