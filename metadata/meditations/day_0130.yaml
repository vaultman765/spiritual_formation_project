meditative_points:
  - He obeyed perfectly — though no crowds heard Him, no records preserved His silence.
  - Divine obedience flourishes where no applause exists.
  - This is the path of the cross, before the cross is seen.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, obedient in silence, teach me the humility of hiddenness.
colloquy: Speak to the Lord in His quiet years. Ask Him to burn away your desire to
  be noticed, and to plant in you a love of obedience known only to Heaven.
resolution: I will joyfully obey in something small today, especially when unseen or unrecognized,
  in imitation of Jesus' obedience in Nazareth.
