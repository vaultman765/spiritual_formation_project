meditative_points:
  - And He was transfigured before them.
  - This is My beloved Son, listen to Him.
  - They saw His glory — veiled no more.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, reveal to me the light of Your glory.
colloquy:
  O radiant Christ, You allowed the veil to be lifted for a moment — that
  we might glimpse Your divinity. Let Your light shine into my darkness. Help me carry
  Your radiance with reverence and humility.
resolution:
  I will pause in silence today to contemplate the glory of Christ — even
  in small or hidden ways.
