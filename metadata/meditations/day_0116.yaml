anchor_image:
  You are among the crowd on the hillside as Jesus speaks with authority.
  His eyes move over the people. You hear Him say, ‘Not everyone who says
  to me, “Lord, Lord,” will enter… but he who does the will of my Father.’

meditative_points:
  - “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord’…” — As Christ looks at me,
    I hear these words not as a threat, but as an invitation to deeper discipleship.
  - Obedience is not mere effort — it is intimacy. The terrifying words
    “I never knew you” are not about failure, but about a life lived apart from Him.’
ejaculatory_prayer: Father, not my will, but Yours be done.
colloquy:
  "Lord Jesus, You obeyed even unto death — and in that obedience You saved
  the world. Help me to love obedience, not as control, but as freedom: to walk in
  the will of the Father with confidence and peace."
resolution:
  I will pause today before every decision and ask, ‘Is this the will of
  the Father?’
