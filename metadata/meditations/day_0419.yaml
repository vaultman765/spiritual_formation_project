meditative_points:
  - See the fire that should have destroyed, now serving as choir, singing praise with frost and dew.
  - "Feel the paradox: scorching heat and bitter cold both bend in harmony before the Lord."
  - Imagine wind and storm rushing into the furnace as instruments of praise, not destruction.
ejaculatory_prayer: "Bless the Lord, all you elements of the earth."
colloquy: Lord, teach me to let even my trials — the heat and frost of life — become praise to You.
resolution: "When encountering discomfort today, say: “Bless the Lord,” turning hardship into worship."
