  - The Cross becomes the place of divine access
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, open to me the sanctuary of the Father’s mercy.
colloquy:
  O Lord, when You died, the veil was torn — not by men, but by God. You opened
  the sanctuary to sinners, to me. No longer am I shut out. Help me never to take
  this access for granted. Let me draw near with trembling awe and grateful trust,
  knowing that the way is open by Your Cross.
resolution:
  Today I will pray slowly and reverently, imagining the veil torn open
  by Christ’s death. I will enter my time of prayer as one who has been granted access
  to the most holy place.
