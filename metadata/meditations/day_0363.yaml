anchor_image: In the village square Jesus lifts a tiny seed between finger and thumb.
  “What is the kingdom of God like? It is like a mustard seed…” Nearby a woman folds leaven into flour;
  everything is quiet, slow, hidden.

meditative_points:
  - Hear the parables spoken directly to you.
  - Stay with the woman kneading leaven through the dough—quiet pressure, patient hands, hidden rise.
  - Feel the slow widening of shade as the mustard tree grows—room for the birds.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, let Your Kingdom rise within me.
colloquy: King Jesus, I crave quick results, yet You choose hidden growth.
  Make my heart soft to Your seed, my habits steady like leaven, my hope patient. Reign quietly and completely in me today.
resolution: Choose one small, repeatable “leaven” practice and begin it today.
