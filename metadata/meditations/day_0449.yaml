meditative_points:
  - The afflicted soul cries, “Do not hide Your face from me”.
  - You feel the fleetingness of life — smoke, grass, withering — and the permanence of God’s mercy.
  - You see Zion rebuilt, God responding to the prayer of the destitute.
ejaculatory_prayer: “Do not hide Your face from me, O Lord.”
colloquy: Lord, though my days vanish like smoke, let me cling to Your eternal mercy. Hear my cry as You heard David’s.
resolution: I will pray for the afflicted and forgotten today, uniting my voice to theirs in intercession.
