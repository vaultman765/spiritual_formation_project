  Sinai thunder and cloud — The mountain shakes, clothed in fire and smoke.
  Lightning flashes. A trumpet sounds. The people tremble as the voice of God roars
  from the cloud.

meditative_points:
  - Only filial fear endures - it is born of love. It doesn't run from God, it kneels before Him.
  - 'St. Catherine distinguishes three types of fear: servile (fear of punishment), mercenary (hope of reward),
    and filial (fear of offending God).'
  - Growth in prayer often means being purified from lower fears and led into true, holy reverence.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, let me fear only offending You
colloquy: Father, purify my fear. I do not want to obey You for gain or out of dread, but because I love You.
resolution: I will reject anxious, servile thoughts today, and instead offer each fear to God in trust.
