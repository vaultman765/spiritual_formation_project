meditative_points:
  - The Son of God humbled Himself, taking the form of a servant. This is the perfection of poverty and simplicity.
  - "In His kenosis I see the path of love: emptying myself so that God may fill me."
  - To be poor in spirit is to imitate Christ, who gained all by losing all.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, empty me of self, fill me with Your Spirit.
colloquy: Speak to Christ crucified and risen. Ask Him to teach you the joy of self-emptying and the richness of true poverty.
resolution: Today I will serve someone in a hidden way, without seeking thanks or notice.
