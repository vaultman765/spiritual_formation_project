meditative_points:
  - "Hear Christ speak to you: “Unless you become like children, you will not enter the Kingdom of Heaven.”"
  - The child before Him is small, dependent, and trusting — this littleness is the gate of the Kingdom.
  - "Spiritual childhood begins with humility: lowering ourselves so God may raise us."
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, make me little before You.
colloquy: Lord, I confess my pride and desire to be great.
  Teach me to choose the littleness of a child, to rest in Your Father’s love as my only boast.
resolution: Today I will accept a humble task or correction without protest, remembering that the Kingdom belongs to the little ones.
