meditative_points:
  - "Jesus looks at me and says: ‘Your Father sees in secret.’"
  - Holiness hidden is not wasted — it is most like Christ.
ejaculatory_prayer: Father, may I be content to be seen by You alone.
colloquy:
  Lord, how often I seek to be noticed. Even my virtue can become vanity.
  Make me content in Your gaze. Let me give, pray, and fast — not to impress, but
  to please You alone.
resolution: I will do one good work today in secret, and not speak of it.
