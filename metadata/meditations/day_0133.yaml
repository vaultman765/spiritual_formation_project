anchor_image:
  You are standing near the tomb of Lazarus. The stone still covers the
  entrance. Jesus approaches, visibly moved — and weeping. The mourners fall silent.
  You are close enough to see His tears.

meditative_points:
  - The Son of God weeps.
  - He approaches the tomb, knowing He will raise Lazarus. But He still enters into
    sorrow.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, weeping for Lazarus, soften my heart.
colloquy:
  Speak to Christ in the moment of His tears. Tell Him of your own losses,
  your fear of death, your love for those you’ve lost. Let His divine sorrow console
  your own.
resolution:
  Today I will offer a prayer for someone I have lost, entrusting them to
  Christ who weeps — and who raises the dead.
