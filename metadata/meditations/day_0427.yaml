anchor_image: Dawn cools the ash heap as Job lifts his cracked voice toward the sky;
  his friends sit rigid around him, the city’s gate far behind, a thin breeze carrying
  dust over his shoulders.

meditative_points:
  - Hear Job weigh his misery against the sand of the sea; feel the heaviness of words that dare to speak before God.
  - Watch the day’s light move across Job’s face while hope and exhaustion wrestle in his breathing.
  - Notice how the complaint itself becomes prayer, a wounded appeal for regard from the living God.
ejaculatory_prayer: Lord, remember me in my affliction.
colloquy: Father, You see my frame and know my limits. Let my cry reach You, and let Your mercy be my breath when strength fails.
resolution: When sorrow presses today, turn it into a simple prayer—one sentence offered to God instead of silent bitterness.
