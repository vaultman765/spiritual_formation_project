meditative_points:
  - Jesus presents His Blood to the Father
  - He invites me to draw near with confidence and trust
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, Eternal Priest, receive me before the throne of grace.
colloquy:
  "O Jesus, Eternal High Priest, You ascended bearing the wounds of my redemption.
  Before the throne of the Father, You offer not another's sacrifice but Your
  own Blood â€” for me. Let me never again be afraid to draw near to You. Fill
  me with awe, gratitude, and a longing to approach You with trust."
resolution:
  I will spend time today in prayer envisioning Christ before the Father,
  and I will speak to Him as one who intercedes for me even now.
