meditative_points:
  - Christ says, 'This is my Body, which is given for you.'
  - "The mystery of real presence: God under the form of bread and wine."
  - The Eucharist as the memorial of Christ’s Passion and the summit of our faith.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, Bread of Life, nourish me with Your presence.
colloquy: O Jesus, who humbly gave Yourself in the form of bread and wine, I adore
  You. Let my soul never stray far from the altar, where You remain with us. May every
  communion be a deeper union with Your Heart.
resolution: I will make a reverent visit to the Blessed Sacrament today, kneeling
  in gratitude for the gift of the Eucharist.
