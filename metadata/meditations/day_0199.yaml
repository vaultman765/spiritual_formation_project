meditative_points:
  - Reach out and place your finger in His wounds. They are not symbols — they are love,
    made visible.
  - Let His pierced side be your refuge. The open Heart of Christ is a shelter no sin
    can block.
  - Dwell in the wounds — they are doors, not scars. Through them flows mercy, not condemnation.
ejaculatory_prayer: Within Your wounds, hide me.
colloquy: Jesus, I flee to the refuge of Your wounds. Let me dwell where Your love
  was poured out. Hide me from the storm of sin, from the enemy’s lies, from despair.
resolution: "When tempted or afraid today, I will repeat: 'Hide me in Your wounds,
  Lord Jesus.'"
