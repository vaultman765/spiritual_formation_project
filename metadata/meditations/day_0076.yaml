meditative_points:
  - Even in sorrow, her Heart magnifies the Lord — the Magnificat never ceases within
    her
  - The silence of her suffering is not empty — it is radiant with interior joy
  - Her joy is not the absence of sorrow, but the presence of God
ejaculatory_prayer: Immaculate Heart of Mary, be my joy in sorrow.
colloquy:
  O Mary, teach me to rejoice in God even through tears. Let me dwell in your
  Heart, where sorrow and joy are not divided. Help me to say 'My soul magnifies the
  Lord' in every trial, and to love in silence as you do.
resolution:
  Today I will unite a difficult task to Mary's joy and offer it for the
  glory of God.
