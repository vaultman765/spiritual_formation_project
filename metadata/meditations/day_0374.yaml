meditative_points:
  - The bush burns without being consumed - God’s holiness made visible.
  - Moses removes his sandals; reverence before the presence of God.
  - "Fire reveals, sanctifies, and calls: “I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”"
ejaculatory_prayer: Holy Spirit, make me burn without being consumed.
colloquy: Lord, Your holiness is fire. Purify my eyes to see, my ears to hear, my heart to respond to Your call as Moses did in awe.
resolution: Today I will pause for a moment of silence before beginning prayer, acknowledging I stand on holy ground.
