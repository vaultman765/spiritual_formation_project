meditative_points:
  - See the Spirit leading Christ — not away from trial, but into it. The desert is the stage of His obedience.
  - Watch Him fast for forty days — the hunger, the weakness, the silence.
  - He enters this trial to undo Adam’s fall and Israel’s failures, for your sake.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, strengthen me in trial.
colloquy: Lord, You embraced the desert for me.
  Teach me to accept the crosses and trials I resist. Lead me into fidelity, not comfort.
resolution: I will fast from one small comfort today, uniting it to Christ’s forty days in the desert.
