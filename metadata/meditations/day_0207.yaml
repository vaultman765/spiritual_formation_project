anchor_image: You are standing with Mary at the foot of the Cross. She gazes upon her Son in agony, hears His words,
  and unites her heart to His sacrifice. John is beside her, and the soldiers are near. Simeon’s prophecy — that a
  sword would pierce her soul — is now fulfilled.

meditative_points:
  - Watch Mary as she offers her Son to the Father — her will united to His perfect obedience.
  - See that her sacrifice is not passive sorrow but active surrender of maternal love.
  - Recognize that she consents to the Redemption, standing as the New Eve beside the New Adam.
ejaculatory_prayer: Mary, teach me to offer all to God with you.
colloquy: Mother, you gave your Son into the hands of the Father for me. Let me learn from you the courage to offer myself
  in love and obedience.
resolution: I will unite one small act of sacrifice today to Christ through Mary, consciously offering it to the Father.
