  A soul stands before the judgment seat of Christ. Nothing is hidden.
  Angels and saints look on in silence. Christ’s face is both merciful
  and just. The soul awaits its sentence.

meditative_points:
  - “It is appointed for men to die once, and after that comes judgment.”
    I will see my soul as it truly is — before the eyes of Christ.
  - “We must all appear before the judgment seat.”
    Not even the smallest act is forgotten — neither sin nor love.
ejaculatory_prayer: Judge of the living and the dead, look on me with mercy when I stand before You.
colloquy: Speak to Christ as the One who will one day reveal all things.
  Ask for the grace to live in the truth now, so that His judgment
  will not be a surprise but a confirmation of your love.
resolution: I will examine my conscience today as if I were preparing to meet
  Christ face-to-face — not later, but now.
