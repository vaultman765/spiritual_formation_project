meditative_points:
  - See Christ in Gethsemane, His sweat like drops of blood as He prays.
  - Hear Him offer loud cries and tears to the Father, as Hebrews recalls.
  - Recognize that His humanity reveals the true depth of prayerful surrender.
ejaculatory_prayer: Father, into Your hands I commend my spirit.
colloquy: O Jesus, teach me to pray with sincerity of heart. May I trust the Father even in trial.
resolution: I will set aside ten minutes today to pray in silence, offering God my fears and struggles.
