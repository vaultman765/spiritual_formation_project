anchor_image: You are kneeling just behind the blind man Bartimaeus on the roadside.
  He cries out — and Jesus stops. You feel the stillness in the crowd as Christ turns,
  drawn by a cry of faith. You gather courage to speak His name.

meditative_points:
  - "Hear the blind man cry out: 'Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!' Let this
    be your cry."
  - Feel Jesus stop — He hears every plea born of faith. His turning is not delayed.
  - Speak His Holy Name in the silence of your heart. He listens as if only you exist.
ejaculatory_prayer: O Good Jesus, hear me.
colloquy: Lord Jesus, You are never deaf to the cries of the broken. In my need, in
  my longing, hear me. Let my prayer rise with confidence, trusting that You turn
  at the sound of my voice.
resolution: I will pray the Holy Name of Jesus often today, especially in moments
  of weakness or doubt.
