meditative_points:
  - Mary carrying the Child into the Temple — the Mother presenting the Son
  - 'The offering is total: flesh of her flesh, now given back to God'
  - She says nothing — her yes was already spoken at the Annunciation
ejaculatory_prayer: Immaculate Heart of Mary, offer me with your Son.
colloquy:
  'O Mary, teach me to offer what I love to the Lord. Let me not cling to
  gifts, but present them with trust. Let your silence in the Temple become my own:
  a yes without words.'
resolution:
  Today I will make a small personal offering in secret, asking Mary to
  join it to her own.
