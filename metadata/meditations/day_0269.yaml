meditative_points:
  - See the thorns pressed into Christ’s head, each wound a crown of love.
  - Recognize His kingship mocked, yet revealed in humility.
  - Ask that your own thoughts and pride be purified in His crowned head.
ejaculatory_prayer: O Christ, be King of my mind and heart.
colloquy: Lord, crowned with thorns, purify my pride and vanity. Reign in my thoughts, my judgments, my whole being.
resolution: I will practice humility in one conversation today, offering Christ a crown of love in place of thorns.
