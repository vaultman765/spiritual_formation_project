meditative_points:
  - "Hear St. Paul reminding you: “He humbled Himself, becoming obedient unto death.”"
  - Watch the Child Christ — obedience is His chosen posture, His language of humility.
  - Ponder how humility and obedience are inseparable, and how both draw you nearer to Christ.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus meek and humble of heart, make my heart like Yours.
colloquy: Lord, I confess my pride that resists obedience.
  Give me the grace to embrace humility through daily submission, as You did in Nazareth.
resolution: I will accept correction today without excuse or complaint.
