meditative_points:
  - "Hear the Apostle warn: “Do not love the world or the things in the world.”"
  - Watch Christ contrast fleeting earthly treasures with eternal riches in heaven.
  - Feel the pull of vanity — and choose instead the eternal way of detachment and love.
ejaculatory_prayer: Lord, free me from love of the world.
colloquy: Jesus, too often I set my heart on passing things. Teach me holy detachment, to desire only what leads me to You.
resolution: I will renounce one vain habit today and redirect that time or energy toward prayer or charity.
