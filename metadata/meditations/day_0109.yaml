meditative_points:
- '“Be it done unto me…” — a consent deeper than words: the surrender of her whole
  being to God’s Word.'
- In Mary’s fiat, the eternal Word finds a dwelling — a total yes.
ejaculatory_prayer: Fiat, O Lord, in me as in Mary — that Thy Word may take root.
colloquy: Father, as Mary surrendered to Your Word in total simplicity, let me say
  my fiat not only with lips but with my entire life. May Your Word be fulfilled in
  me, even in what I do not yet understand.
resolution: I will repeat Mary’s fiat interiorly before beginning any new task today.
