day_title: Passion of Christ, Strengthen Me
anchor_image: You are in the Garden of Gethsemane. The night is thick with dread.
  You see Jesus kneeling alone, trembling, sweat like blood falling to the ground.
  An angel appears, strengthening Him. You feel the weight of His sorrow, borne
  for love of you.

meditative_points:
  - Watch Christ fall prostrate, sorrowful unto death. He sees all sin — yours included — and does not turn away.
  - Hear Him say, “Not My will, but Yours be done.” This strength is not escape from suffering, but perfect submission to the Father.
  - Feel the presence of the angel — divine strength offered not to remove pain, but to endure it with love.
ejaculatory_prayer: Passion of Christ, strengthen me.
colloquy: O Jesus, in Your agony, You bore my weakness. Strengthen me to carry the crosses I would rather cast aside. Let me not flee
  from the chalice You place before me.
resolution: "I will not run from today’s difficulties, but offer them in union with Christ’s Passion, saying: “Thy will be done.”"
