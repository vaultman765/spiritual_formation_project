meditative_points:
  - "Here St. Paul's words spoken to you: “You are God’s temple and the Spirit of God dwells in you.”"
  - The Spirit tests each work by fire — what is founded on Christ remains, what is vain burns away.
  - The Living Flame is not distant but within, making the soul luminous with divine love.
ejaculatory_prayer: Come, Holy Spirit, dwell as fire in my soul.
colloquy: Lord, let my heart be Your sanctuary. Kindle within me a flame that endures, purifies, and shines in hidden union with You.
resolution: I will pause in silence today, inviting the Spirit to renew His dwelling in my soul.
