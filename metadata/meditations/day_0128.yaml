  You are beside the small home at Nazareth in the early morning. Jesus

  Father.

meditative_points:
  - Before He taught the crowds, He prayed alone in silence.
  - "Prayer opens the understanding to the brightness of Divine Light, and the will to the warmth of Heavenly
    Love — nothing can so effectually purify the mind from its many ignorances, or the will from its perverse affections"
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, draw me into the silence where You worship the Father.
colloquy:
  Lord, so few saw You pray — but it was the source of everything. Teach me
  to love the invisible prayer. Let me begin my day like You did — not in haste, but
  in quiet communion with the Father.
resolution:
  I will begin tomorrow with 10 minutes of silent prayer before anything
  else.
