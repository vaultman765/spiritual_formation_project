meditative_points:
  - “Behold the handmaid of the Lord.” — this is not passivity, but perfect readiness
    to serve the will of God.
  - "Mary identifies herself entirely as belonging to the Lord: no identity outside
    of service to Him."
  - The one chosen to bear the Son is the one who calls herself servant.
ejaculatory_prayer: O Mary, teach me to call myself the servant of the Lord in truth
  and joy.
colloquy: Mother of humility, you did not grasp or claim anything for yourself, but
  declared yourself handmaid of the Lord. In your silence and peace, teach me to rejoice
  in the will of God above all else. Let me be content to be His servant.
resolution: "Today I will quietly repeat: “Behold the servant of the Lord” during
  moments of pride or resistance."
