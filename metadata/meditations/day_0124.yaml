meditative_points:
  - “You cannot serve two masters” — I hear His words cut through the crowd like a sword.
  - "I feel the sting of the choice: will I serve Him, or something else?"
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, I renounce every false master. You alone are Lord.
colloquy: Lord, I want to serve You without compromise. I see how easily I serve approval,
  control, money, self. You call me to love with an undivided heart. Burn away my
  double-mindedness. Let me be Yours alone.
resolution: I will examine one area where I feel torn between God and something else
  — and choose Him today.
