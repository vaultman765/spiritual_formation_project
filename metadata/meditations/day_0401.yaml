meditative_points:
  - “The Bridegroom was delayed.” Stay in the long obedience of love.
  - “Give us some of your oil.” Watch how borrowed fervor cannot burn for you.
  - “Keep awake… you know neither the day nor the hour.” Let vigilance become your posture.
ejaculatory_prayer: Come, Lord Jesus—keep my lamp burning.
colloquy: Lord, fill my vessel with the oil of living faith. Guard me from presumption and sloth; make me ready when You come.
resolution: I will set a concrete watchpoint today (time and place) for prayer, guarding it as my lamp-trimming.
