meditative_points:
  - The joy of Jesus in ordinary tasks — labor made luminous by love.
  - He who holds the stars bends to sweep the floor beside His mother.
  - In Nazareth, divine charity sanctifies the unnoticed.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus of Nazareth, sanctify my daily labor.
colloquy:
  Speak to Christ, who worked and lived humbly under the gaze of Mary and
  Joseph. Ask for the grace to find Him in the small things, and to offer your ordinary
  life as a dwelling for His hidden presence.
resolution:
  Today, I will find joy in a simple task, offering it to Jesus as an act of love.
  I will remember that even the smallest acts can be sanctified by His presence.
