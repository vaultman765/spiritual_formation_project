day_title: Mary, Mother of the Church
anchor_image: You are standing with Mary at the foot of the Cross. She gazes upon her Son in agony, hears His words,
  and unites her heart to His sacrifice. John is beside her, and the soldiers are near. Simeon’s prophecy — that a
  sword would pierce her soul — is now fulfilled.

meditative_points:
  - Hear Christ’s words from the Cross entrusting John — and all disciples — to Mary as Mother.
  - See her receive the Church in sorrow, her motherhood expanded through suffering.
  - "Understand that her mission continues: to intercede, protect, and guide us as her children."
ejaculatory_prayer: Mary, Mother of the Church, pray for us.
colloquy: Jesus, thank You for giving me Your Mother as my own. Mary, I entrust myself and the whole Church to your maternal
  care — keep us faithful to your Son.
resolution: Today I will pray for the Church with Mary, especially for her pastors,
  asking her maternal intercession for unity and holiness.
