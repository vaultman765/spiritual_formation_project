meditative_points:
  - See the multitudes rushing toward the wide road — glittering but empty, leading to ruin.
  - Hear Christ’s voice urging you toward the narrow gate and to build your life on His words.
  - Stand firm on the rock of obedience, knowing storms will come but His foundation remains.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, guide me through the narrow gate.
colloquy: Lord, the road of ease tempts me, yet You call me higher. Give me courage to walk the narrow way and to build on You alone.
resolution: "Today I will examine my choices and ask: Am I building on sand or on the rock of Christ’s word?"
