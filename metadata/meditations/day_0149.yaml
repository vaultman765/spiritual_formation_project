meditative_points:
  - Watch with the apostles as Christ gives His Body and Blood in the first Eucharist.
    Listen as He promises eternal life to those who receive Him with faith.
  - Place yourself at the altar in every Mass, receiving the chalice that contains the
    same Precious Blood poured out on Calvary.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, may Your Precious Blood in the Eucharist unite me to You forever.
colloquy: Speak to Christ present in the Eucharist. Thank Him for making His sacrifice truly present,
  and ask for the grace to receive Him with pure love, faith, and awe at every Mass.
resolution: Today, I will attend Mass (if possible) or make a spiritual communion,
  uniting myself to Christ’s sacrifice and His Precious Blood.
