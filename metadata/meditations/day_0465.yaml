meditative_points:
  - Mortification that seeks notice has already lost its reward. Can you suffer small inconveniences unseen?
  - The smallest hidden sacrifice, offered in love, reshapes the heart more than grand visible acts.
  - The Father sees what no one else sees. Mortification becomes intimacy.
ejaculatory_prayer: Father, who sees in secret, purify my intentions.
colloquy: Ask for the grace to embrace small daily sacrifices without complaint or display.
resolution: Today I will accept one unnoticed inconvenience silently and offer it to God.
