anchor_image:
  Christ washing the disciples’ feet — The Son of God kneels in the dust.
  He touches dirt and fatigue, pouring water not only onto their feet, but into their
  shame. This is love made visible in humility.

meditative_points:
  - '"Let us not love in word or speech but in deed and in truth." (1 Jn 3:18) — Love
    is not measured by intention, but by sacrifice.'
  - '"Even as I have loved you, you also should love one another." (Jn 13:34) — Christ
    loved with His whole body — His hands, His voice, His wounds.'
  - 'The Catechism speaks of structures of solidarity. I must become one: a living witness
    to love.'
ejaculatory_prayer: Let me love as You have loved me.
colloquy:
  Jesus, let my love stop being abstract. Make it physical, specific, real
  — as Yours was. Teach me to love in the dust, not just in ideas.
resolution:
  Today I will choose one act of embodied charity — and do it promptly,
  not later.
