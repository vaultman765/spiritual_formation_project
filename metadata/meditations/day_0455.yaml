meditative_points:
  - "Christ summarizes the law: to love God with all your heart and your neighbor as yourself — the whole moral life hangs here."
  - You see how each commandment is not a restriction but a mirror of love — where you are faithful, where you have failed.
  - Before the crucifix, you hear the law spoken anew in Christ’s voice, not as cold stone but as fire of love.
ejaculatory_prayer: “Lord, teach me to love in every commandment.”
colloquy: O Jesus, I have failed in many ways, yet You fulfilled the law perfectly in love.
  Write this law upon my heart that I may walk in freedom.
resolution: I will reread the Ten Commandments prayerfully tonight and confess one concrete way I have not kept them.
