anchor_image: You are at Calvary. Christ hangs on the Cross. He lifts His eyes to heaven and breathes,
  “Father, into Your hands I commend My spirit.” Mary and John remain still beneath the darkened sky.

meditative_points:
  - Hear Christ’s final words. There is no fear, only surrender. This is the model of a holy death.
  - Feel the hush as He breathes His last — the veil torn, the earth trembling. Death has no sting for those who die in Him.
  - Ask now for the grace of perseverance — that when your own hour comes, He will call you by name.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, remember me when You come into Your kingdom.
colloquy: O Crucified Lord, let me die as You died — in obedience, in peace, in the Father’s hands.
  When my final hour comes, call me swiftly to Yourself.
resolution: I will prepare for death by making a sincere Act of Contrition tonight, and entrusting my soul to Christ’s mercy.
