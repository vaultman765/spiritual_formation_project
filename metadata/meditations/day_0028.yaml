  '**The Path Beyond the Gate** — You walk through a field where the confessional once stood.
  The breeze is gentle, the sky clear. Yet behind you lies shadow, and ahead the road bends sharply.
  You know now what must be guarded.'

meditative_points:
  - "'See, you are well again. Sin no more, that nothing worse may happen to you.' —
    Forgiveness is not a license to forget, but a commission to remain awake."
  - 'The soul just reconciled is most vulnerable. Satan hates the freshly cleansed —
    for they are closest to returning fully to the Father’s house.'
  - 'Vigilance is not fear. It is humility dressed as attention. Grace stands guard, but the will must not sleep.'
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, help me remain faithful after mercy.
colloquy:
  Ask the Lord to grant you a vigilant heart — one that rejoices in mercy but remembers your weakness.
  Speak to Him about your fears of falling again. Offer your desire to remain near Him, no matter what temptations return.
resolution:
  Choose one daily practice that will guard your soul this week — morning offering, examination of conscience,
  spiritual reading — and begin it today. Do not let grace fade unattended.
