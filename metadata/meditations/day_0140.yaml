anchor_image: Christ stands in radiant light. Every soul’s secrets are exposed — not in cruelty,

  left in shadow.

meditative_points:
  - “He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness.” Saint Paul is speaking this to me directly.
  - The light pours out from Christ. Shadows disappear. What was whispered in darkness is now known in the light.
  - In His gaze, there is no shame — only clarity, and the invitation to love as He loves.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, let Your light search me now, before my judgment.
colloquy: Remain before Christ’s shining face. Offer Him your secrets and your wounds — all is safe in His mercy.
resolution: Today I will make a simple, honest confession to God, hiding nothing, so that I may live in His light.
