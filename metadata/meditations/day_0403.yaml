meditative_points:
  - “God, be merciful to me, a sinner.” Let this be your place before the Lord.
  - See the Pharisee’s self-praise and the publican’s self-accusation—two postures, two outcomes.
  - Hear Jesus declare who went home justified.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, give me the humility that justifies.
colloquy: Lord, I renounce comparison and self-exaltation. Set me in truth, beneath Your gaze, and give me the heart of the publican.
resolution: I will make a brief act of contrition today, owning one concrete fault without excuse.
