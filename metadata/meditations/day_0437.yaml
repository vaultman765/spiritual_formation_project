day_title: Eliphaz’s Final Accusation — “Return to the Almighty”
anchor_image: Morning light slants across the ash heap as Eliphaz approaches for a
  third time. His words are polished and severe—naming hidden sins, promising gold
  if Job will only repent. You feel the tension in the air as Job listens without
  protesting.

meditative_points:
  - Accusation spoken with certainty, resting on appearances alone, brushes past the mystery of a righteous sufferer.
  - The soul sits with Job in a silence that refuses both self-justification and false repentance.
ejaculatory_prayer: “Jesus, meek and humble of heart, teach me truth without harshness.”
colloquy: Lord, I have spoken hard truths without love and heard true words used to wound.
  Purify my lips and my hearing; let your mercy, not my measure, lead repentance.
resolution: Before correcting anyone today, pause to pray one Hail Mary and ask for gentleness in speech.
