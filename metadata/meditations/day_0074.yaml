meditative_points:
  - "Simeon’s voice: 'A sword shall pierce your own soul also'"
  - Her Heart receives the wound before the Passion has begun
  - Mary suffers with Christ — not in body, but in perfect union of love
ejaculatory_prayer: Immaculate Heart of Mary, pierced for love, strengthen mine.
colloquy:
  O Mary, pierced by the Word, let me not flee the sword of love. Make me
  brave to stand with you, wounded but faithful, at every cross I encounter. I place
  my heart beside yours.
resolution:
  I will embrace today’s suffering quietly, joining it to Mary's pierced
  Heart.
