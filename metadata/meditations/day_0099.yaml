meditative_points:
  - Jesus descends into the Jordan not for His own sake, but to sanctify the waters
    for us
  - "The heavens open, revealing the Trinity - the voice of the Father, the presence
    of the Spirit, the beloved Son"
  - "Here begins His public mission - with humility, submission, and divine affirmation"
ejaculatory_prayer: Beloved Son of the Father, immerse me in Your light.
colloquy: "O Jesus, in Your baptism You identified Yourself with sinners. Wash me
  anew in the grace of Your humility. May I hear the Father's voice call me
  His beloved through You, and may the Spirit rest upon me as I begin anew."
resolution: Today I will renew my baptismal promises in prayer, consciously renouncing
  sin and choosing to live for God.
