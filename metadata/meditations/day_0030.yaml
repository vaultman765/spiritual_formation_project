anchor_image:
  "**Christ Bound and Tried** Judas kisses Him in the garden. Guards seize Him. He is dragged before the high priest.
  You see false witnesses, spittle, blows. Peter warms himself by the fire outside. A rooster crows. Jesus remains silent."

meditative_points:
  - Judas betrays Him with a kiss — and Christ still calls him "friend."
  - False witnesses rise — and He speaks not a word in defense.
  - Peter denies Him — and He turns and looks at him with love.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, silent before Your accusers, speak peace into my unrest.
colloquy:
  Jesus, You endured every insult, lie, and abandonment — without retaliation. Teach me to bear small wrongs without lashing out.
  Let me stay close by the fire and not deny You.
resolution: Today I will choose not to defend myself in one moment of misunderstanding — and instead offer it in reparation for betrayal.
