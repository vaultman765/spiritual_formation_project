meditative_points:
  - “Learn from Me…” — Christ looks longingly at you as he invites you to follow Him;
  - To follow the counsels is to imitate Christ crucified — to love like Him.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, Counselor of my soul, let me learn from You.
colloquy: Christ, poor and radiant, obedient unto death, and pure in heart — I adore
  You. Make me a living echo of Your life. Let the counsels not be vows only for a
  few, but paths for all who love You. Teach me to follow You in spirit and in truth.
resolution: Today I will reread each counsel and ask Christ where He wants me to grow.
