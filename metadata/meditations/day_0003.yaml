anchor_image: The Crucified Christ (Face) — You gaze upon the face of Christ crucified.
  His eyes are closed, His head bowed beneath the crown of thorns. From this suffering
  Face shines infinite love. Every wound speaks the truth of God’s heart.

meditative_points:
  - “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart…” (Deut 6:5)
  - “God is… at the same time goodness and loving care for all His children.” (CCC 239)
  - God asks for *all* not to burden us — but because He gives *all*.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, take all — my heart, soul, and strength.
colloquy: Jesus, I want to love You fully, but I hold back. Break open the hidden
  places of my heart so that nothing is left outside Your love.
resolution: Today, I will consciously invite God into one part of my life I usually
  keep separate — a task, a worry, a relationship.
