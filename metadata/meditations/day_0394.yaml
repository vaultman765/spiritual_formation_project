anchor_image: You stand on the shore of the Sea of Galilee. Jesus is a short distance offshore in a boat, teaching the crowd.
  The water carries His voice; the sun is high; the press of people quiets as He begins to speak.

meditative_points:
  - "“The Kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field.”"
  - See the man uncover the treasure; feel the sudden joy that sends him to sell all.
  - Remain with that joy that makes total exchange effortless.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, be my treasure and my joy.
colloquy: Lord, place in me the joy that counts all as loss compared with You.
  Free my heart for the great exchange.
resolution: I will renounce one unnecessary attachment today as an act of love for Christ.
