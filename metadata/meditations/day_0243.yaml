meditative_points:
  - Watch Peter and John lay hands on the new believers, and the Spirit descends.
  - Realize the gifts are poured out sacramentally in Baptism and Confirmation.
  - See your own anointing as the moment the Spirit sealed you for mission.
ejaculatory_prayer: Holy Spirit, renew in me the grace of my Confirmation.
colloquy: Lord, thank You for pouring out Your Spirit in the sacraments. Help me live from this anointing every day.
resolution: I will recall my Baptism and Confirmation today, renewing my “yes” to the Spirit’s presence.
