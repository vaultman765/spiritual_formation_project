meditative_points:
  - “My soul is sorrowful even to death.”
  - “Father… let this cup pass… nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will.”
  - "The sleeping disciples — and Jesus returning again: “Watch and pray… the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”"
ejaculatory_prayer: Father, not my will, but Yours be done.
colloquy: Speak to the Father about the cross presently before you. Ask for the grace not to escape it, but to unite it to Christ.
resolution: Today I will accept one difficulty without complaint and unite it consciously to Christ in Gethsemane.
