meditative_points:
  - "“A merchant in search of fine pearls… on finding one of great value, went and sold all he had.”"
  - Watch the merchant’s careful search end in a single, decisive purchase.
  - Let the worth of the Pearl steady your heart for an undivided choice.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, my priceless Pearl, claim my whole heart.
colloquy: Lord, You are worth everything. Gather my scattered desires into one love,
  and keep me faithful to the choice of You.
resolution: I will simplify one area of my life today to guard an undivided love for Christ.
