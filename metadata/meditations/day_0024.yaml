  '**The Interior Battle** — You are in a dark room with two voices speaking from either side:
  one of accusation, the other of hope. Your hands are bound, but your heart stirs.
  You cry out for freedom, even as the chains tighten. Christ stands silently before you, holding the key.
  He waits for your plea.'

meditative_points:
  - "'I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate.' (v. 15) — The soul in grace still feels torn —
    this is not hypocrisy, but the condition of fallen nature. You must not despair."
  - "The interior cry — 'Who will deliver me from this body of death?' — is the beginning of humility.
    The grace to call out is already a sign that you have not given up."
  - 'Christ does not answer with blame, but with presence. He waits at the door of your heart, not with rebuke, but with the key.'
ejaculatory_prayer: O Jesus, deliver me from myself.
colloquy: Speak to the Lord from within the tension you feel.
  Admit the sins that bind you, and the fears that keep you from choosing freedom.
  Ask Him not only to set you free, but to strengthen your will to live as one redeemed.
resolution:
  "Tonight, when you feel temptation, whisper: 'Who will deliver me?' and immediately say:
  'Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.'"
