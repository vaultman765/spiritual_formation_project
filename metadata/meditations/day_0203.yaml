meditative_points:
  - Gaze on the unnumbered host, clothed in white — the victorious who suffered and persevered.
  - "Hear the endless hymn: “Salvation belongs to our God!” The Lamb in the center is all their joy."
  - Long to be counted among them — not for glory, but to behold God and praise Him without end.
ejaculatory_prayer: Lord, bring me home to You.
colloquy: Jesus, let me love You forever. Bid me come to You, and never let me be parted.
  I desire nothing but to join the saints in Your praise.
resolution: I will renew my desire for heaven by praying the Gloria slowly and attentively today — with all the saints in mind.
