anchor_image: "**The Divine Physician Finds the Lost Sheep** — You see yourself wounded and alone, far from the flock. Christ appears—not with reproach, but with urgency. He kneels beside you, binding your wounds with gentleness. He lifts you onto His shoulders. You feel the weight of your sin, but also the warmth of His mercy."

meditative_points:
  - "He finds you lying there — wounded, ashamed, and hidden in the thorns. He does not hesitate. He draws near, bends low, and lifts you onto His shoulders. This is the true image of mercy."
  - "You were not lost to Him. You were always known, always loved — even in your sin. The Shepherd did not stumble upon you by chance; He came searching."
  - "'There will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents...' (v. 7) — Imagine the celebration in heaven at your return. Do you believe it? Will you let yourself be found?"
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, carry me in Your mercy, and let me never flee Your love again.
colloquy: Speak to the Lord as one who has been found. Confess how far you wandered, but let your sorrow melt into gratitude. Let yourself be carried — without resistance — and feel the strength of His shoulders.
resolution: "Today, reread the parable slowly. Ask yourself: do I believe God rejoices over my return? Let this truth shape your next confession."
