meditative_points:
  - 'Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life.'
  - The Eucharist is not a symbol—it is Christ Himself, veiled in sacrament.
  - The soul is invited to gaze in adoration at Love incarnate in the Host.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus in the Host, I adore You hidden and humble.
colloquy:
  Lord, let me never grow cold before the mystery of Your Body and Blood.
  May my heart burn with reverence, and my life proclaim the truth of Your sacramental
  presence.
resolution:
  I will spend a moment today in silent adoration, meditating on the humility
  of Christ in the Eucharist.
