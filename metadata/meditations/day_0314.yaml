meditative_points:
  - Hear Jesus’ words, “Watch and pray,” spoken directly to you in the garden.
  - See His sweat fall like drops of blood as His disciples sleep nearby.
  - Feel the call to remain spiritually awake with Him in His hour of trial.
ejaculatory_prayer: Lord, keep me awake in prayer with You.
colloquy: Jesus, how often I have slept in spirit when You asked me to watch. Forgive my negligence and draw me into Your vigil of love.
resolution: I will make one deliberate act of watchfulness today — pausing to pray instead of turning to distraction.
