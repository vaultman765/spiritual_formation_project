meditative_points:
  - "Hear Jesus say: “This is eternal life, that they know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.”"
  - Realize eternal life begins now — in knowing and loving the Father through the Son.
  - See that all Christ’s works were to reveal the Father and bring you into this communion.
ejaculatory_prayer: Lord, let me know You and love You more each day.
colloquy: Jesus, You are eternal life. Draw me into deeper knowledge of the Father through You.
resolution: I will spend five minutes today in silent prayer, simply resting in the presence of the Father through Christ.
