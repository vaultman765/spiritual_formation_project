meditative_points:
  - "Jesus tells me: ‘Consider the lilies…’ — not with vague admiration, but as a call
    to let go of anxiety."
  - The flower does not strive, but it glorifies God by simply being what it was made
    to be.
  - When I cling to fear or control, I betray my poverty of trust.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, teach me to trust the Father as the lilies do.
colloquy:
  Lord, I believe — help my unbelief. The lilies preach without speaking.
  Let me learn their hidden sermon. Free me from the lie that I must secure everything.
  I want to rest in Your providence, not my plans.
resolution:
  I will entrust one concrete worry to God today — naming it aloud in prayer
  and surrender.
