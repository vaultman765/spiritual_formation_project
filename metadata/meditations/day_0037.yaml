day_title: The Piercing of His Side – The Birth of the Church
anchor_image: "**The Piercing of His Side** The sky has gone still.
  Christ’s body hangs lifeless. A soldier steps forward and thrusts a spear into His side.
  Blood and water pour out — not just fluid, but the birth of the Church. Mary sees it all. The silence deepens."

meditative_points:
  - The Church is born not from Christ’s preaching, but from His side.
  - Blood and water — Baptism and Eucharist — flow from love.
  - Even in death, Christ gives everything.
ejaculatory_prayer: Sacred Heart of Jesus, pierced for me, make me Yours.
colloquy:
  Jesus, from Your pierced Heart flowed the Church, my Baptism, my salvation.
  Let me never forget that the Church was born in suffering, silence, and mercy.
resolution: Today I will reverence the Church as Christ’s Bride — by guarding my speech and praying for her sanctity.
