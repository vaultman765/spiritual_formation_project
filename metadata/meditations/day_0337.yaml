meditative_points:
  - "Contemplate Christ as the New Adam: where Adam fell in a garden, Christ stands firm in the desert."
  - "Contemplate Christ as the New Israel: where Israel tested God in the wilderness, Christ obeys perfectly."
  - Know this victory is yours — His obedience heals your disobedience, His triumph over temptation is your hope.
ejaculatory_prayer: Christ my Victor, conquer in me.
colloquy: Lord, I am weak like Adam, like Israel. But You are strong.
  Let Your victory be mine. Let me walk with You through temptation into fidelity.
resolution: In a moment of temptation today, I will explicitly call on Christ as my strength and recall His victory in the desert.
