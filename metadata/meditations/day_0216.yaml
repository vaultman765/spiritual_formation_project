anchor_image: "You are in the assembly at Corinth as Paul exhorts the faithful: “The cup of blessing that we bless,
  is it not a participation in the Blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the Body
  of Christ? Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body.”"

meditative_points:
  - Hear Paul declare the Eucharist a true participation in Christ’s Body and Blood.
  - See that in this one bread the many become one — the Church is made one Body.
  - Learn from the early witness of Ignatius that the Eucharist is the flesh of Christ and the bond of unity.
ejaculatory_prayer: Lord, make us one in Your Body and Blood.
colloquy: Jesus, I thank You that in the Eucharist You unite us not only with Yourself but with one another.
  Preserve me always in the unity of Your Church.
resolution: I will pray today for greater unity in the Church, especially at the Eucharist, where we are made one Body.
