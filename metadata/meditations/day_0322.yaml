meditative_points:
  - See Joseph stop his work, Jesus pausing with him — silence speaks louder than words.
  - In the still moment, the workshop becomes a place of contemplation.
  - Recognize how pauses in your own labor can be prayer when lifted to God.
ejaculatory_prayer: Lord, sanctify my pauses in silence.
colloquy: Jesus, teach me that silence can be as holy as speech. In my work and rest, may I find You.
resolution: I will take one intentional pause of silence in my work today, offering it to God as worship.
