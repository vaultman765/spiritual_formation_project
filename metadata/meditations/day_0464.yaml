meditative_points:
  - Mortification begins not in punishment, but in clarity — seeing what draws you away from God.
  - To crucify the flesh is to detach from what promises life but delivers restlessness.
ejaculatory_prayer: Holy Spirit, strengthen what is weak in me.
colloquy: Speak honestly to the Lord about the attachments that quietly rule you. Ask for interior freedom.
resolution: Today I will practice interior watchfulness over one recurring temptation.
