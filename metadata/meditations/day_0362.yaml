meditative_points:
  - "Hear His first words as if to you alone: “Repent, and believe in the good news.”"
  - Watch the nets hit the ground and the men move at once.
  - Identify, in this scene, the one thing you would have to leave to take a literal step after Him.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus my King, speak—and I will follow.
colloquy: Lord Jesus, Your word carries both urgency and peace. I confess my delays and divided heart.
  Give me the courage and simplicity of the fishermen—swift obedience born of love. Call me again now, and I will go.
resolution: Name one “net” you will drop before day’s end (habit, compromise, distraction) and take the first concrete step to leave it.
