meditative_points:
  - Hear Job curse the day of his birth; feel the weight of words that do not deny God but bring anguish before Him.
  - Taste the edge of night where light seems like darkness; notice how lament still presumes that God hears.
  - Let the rawness of the cry strip pious masks; remain with Job in truth before the living God.
ejaculatory_prayer: O God, hear my cry in the night.
colloquy: Father, I bring You my unvarnished sorrow. Receive it as prayer; do not let my grief close my heart to Your mercy.
resolution: Pray one psalm of lament slowly today, allowing one line to become your prayer.
