day_title: Standing with Mary
anchor_image: You are standing with Mary at the foot of the Cross. She gazes upon her Son in agony, hears His words,
  and unites her heart to His sacrifice. John is beside her, and the soldiers are near. Simeon’s prophecy — that a
  sword would pierce her soul — is now fulfilled.

meditative_points:
  - "See Mary’s steadfastness: she does not flee but remains standing by the Cross."
  - Notice her courage — she is not crushed by sorrow but strengthened in fidelity.
  - Learn that true discipleship means to stay with Christ even in His humiliation.
ejaculatory_prayer: Mary, keep me faithful at the foot of the Cross.
colloquy: Mother, I fear weakness and flight in suffering. Help me to stand firm with you, never abandoning Christ in His Passion.
resolution: I will remain with patience in one difficulty today, consciously staying “at the Cross” in spirit with Mary.
