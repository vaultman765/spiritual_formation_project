meditative_points:
  - Satan shows Christ the kingdoms of the world, promising glory in exchange for worship.
  - "See Christ’s decisive rejection: “The Lord your God shall you worship, Him alone shall you serve.”"
  - Where Adam and Israel fell into idolatry, Christ stands firm as the true Son.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, keep me faithful to the one true God.
colloquy: Lord, I reject the false kingdoms of ambition and pride. Let me bow before You alone. Be my King, my treasure, my reward.
resolution: I will renounce one earthly attachment today and offer that act of surrender to God.
