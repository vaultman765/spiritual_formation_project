anchor_image:
  '**Christ Revealing His Sacred Heart in Glory** — You kneel before the risen Christ. His eyes are like fire and mercy.
  His hands are extended in blessing, and His robe gleams like light.
  But what draws your soul is His Heart — visible, radiant, pierced, encircled with thorns, and burning with love.
  It is not a wound of shame, but a throne of glory. He says nothing.
  He simply shows you the place where divine love became visible. Each title of the Litany is real here.
  You gaze at the Heart… and see eternity.'

meditative_points:
  - The Heart of Jesus is not only loving — it is trustworthy
  - Trust is not passivity — it is courageous surrender
  - Little souls reach Heaven not by effort, but by confidence
ejaculatory_prayer: Heart of Jesus, salvation of those who trust, I surrender again.
colloquy:
  Jesus, give me the boldness of Thérèse — not to be perfect, but to trust.
  Let me believe that Your Heart will carry me, even when I fall.
resolution: 'Today, I will repeat often: "Jesus, I trust in You," especially when tempted to despair or self-reliance.'
