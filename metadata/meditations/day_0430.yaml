day_title: Zophar’s Rebuke — Condemnation without Knowledge
anchor_image: Under the white blaze of noon, Zophar leans forward on the edge of the ash heap, finger raised as he lectures;
  Job sits motionless, eyes lowered, the wind lifting a veil of dust between them.

meditative_points:
  - Hear Zophar’s sharp certainty strike the wounded air; feel how “answers” can harden into stones.
  - Watch Job bear the weight of accusation, silence stretched between justice and mercy.
  - Let the unseen God remain present in the dust—greater than our verdicts, nearer than our proofs.
ejaculatory_prayer: Lord, deliver me from rash judgment.
colloquy: Jesus, meek and humble of heart, quiet the impulse to condemn. Teach me to see as You see and to wait upon Your truth.
resolution: Today refrain from any judgmental comment; replace it with one sincere prayer for the person instead.
