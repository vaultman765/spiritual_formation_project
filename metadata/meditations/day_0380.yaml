meditative_points:
  - "Christ points to sparrows and flowers: the Father provides for all creation — will He not care for you?"
  - "Thérèse teaches that trust in the Father is the child’s way: simple surrender, without fear."
  - The Father’s love frees you from anxious striving; your task is to seek first His Kingdom.
ejaculatory_prayer: Father, I trust in Your care.
colloquy: Lord Jesus, teach me to rest in the Father’s providence. Deliver me from worry, and let me live each moment in trustful surrender.
resolution: I will entrust one concrete concern to God today, refusing to take it back in anxious thought.
