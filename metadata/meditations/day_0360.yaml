day_title: The Son of Man Has Nowhere to Lay His Head

meditative_points:
  - Christ embraced homelessness for my sake. True discipleship means following Him without clinging to comfort or security.
  - "Simplicity demands trust: not knowing where I will rest, yet knowing Who sustains me."
  - Poverty of spirit opens me to rely fully on the Father’s providence.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, let me follow You without reserve.
colloquy: Tell Christ about the fears you feel when He asks for radical trust.
  Ask Him to give you courage to walk with Him into uncertainty.
resolution: Today I will accept one inconvenience or interruption as a chance to follow Christ’s poverty more closely.
