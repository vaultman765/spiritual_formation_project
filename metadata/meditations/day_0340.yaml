meditative_points:
  - See the flaming darts of the evil one strike and vanish on the shield you hold — faith quenches every attack.
  - “Do not be afraid; only believe.” His promise steadies your hands.
  - Feel confidence grow as you grip the shield tighter — it is not your power, but His faithfulness.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, strengthen my faith.
colloquy: Lord, I believe — help my unbelief. Be my defense when doubt and fear rise against me.
resolution: I will recite the Creed slowly today, making it my shield against temptation.
