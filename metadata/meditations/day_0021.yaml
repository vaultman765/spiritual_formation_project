  Sinai thunder and cloud — The mountain shakes, clothed in fire and smoke.
  Lightning flashes. A trumpet sounds. The people tremble as the voice of God roars
  from the cloud.

meditative_points:
  - "Paradox: fear draws us nearer. True fear does not drive the soul away — it compels it to cling more tightly to God."
  - Holy fear is not opposed to love; it **protects** love. It guards the soul from pride and familiar irreverence.
  - Fear that remains in Heaven is the soul's eternal awe before infinite beauty.
ejaculatory_prayer: Let me fear You forever with love and wonder.
colloquy: Lord, let my fear be crowned by love. May I never lose the trembling that keeps me close to You forever.
resolution: Today, I will end my prayer with adoration—kneeling, bowed, silent.
