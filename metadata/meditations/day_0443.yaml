meditative_points:
  - Youthful zeal meets ancient sorrow—the air prickles with expectancy.
  - “The breath of the Almighty gives understanding”—wisdom descends, it is not seized.
  - "Lightning sketches the clouds: correction that is mercy prepares the ear for God’s voice."
ejaculatory_prayer: “Breathe in me, O Holy Spirit.”
colloquy: Lord, purify my zeal; make it patient, teachable, and kind. Form my conscience to listen more than to speak.
resolution: Practice one deliberate moment of silence before each important decision today;
  whisper “Speak, Lord, your servant is listening.”
