meditative_points:
  - Earthly treasures rot and fade, but heaven’s treasure endures forever.
  - Simplicity means choosing one Master. Compromise leaves the soul divided and restless.
  - "Christ calls me to freedom: letting go of what weighs me down so I can belong wholly to Him."
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, You alone are my treasure.
colloquy: Speak to Christ about the treasure you cling to most. Offer it into His hands and ask Him to purify your heart’s desire.
resolution: Today I will name one attachment in my heart and consciously choose Christ as the greater good.
