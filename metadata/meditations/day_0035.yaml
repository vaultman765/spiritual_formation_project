day_title: Mary at the Foot of the Cross – The Silent Fiat
anchor_image:
  '**Mary at the Foot of the Cross** Mary stands beneath the Cross, silent. Her Son hangs above her.
  She does not cry aloud — her sorrow is still, total, unresisting. John is beside her. Christ says, "Behold your mother."
  She receives the Church into her heart.'

meditative_points:
  - Mary does not cry out — she consents with her silence.
  - Her motherhood expands to include the Church at the Cross.
  - She suffers with Christ — not passively, but as co-sufferer in faith.
ejaculatory_prayer: O Mary, Mother of Sorrows, form Christ in me.
colloquy:
  Mother, I stand with you beneath the Cross. Teach me to suffer without resisting love.
  Let me receive the Church into my heart as you did.
resolution: Today I will embrace one sorrow silently — offering it with Mary for the Church.
