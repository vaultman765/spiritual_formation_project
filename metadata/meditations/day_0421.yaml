meditative_points:
  - See the flames curl and leap—yet a cool breath moves within them. The same God who sends fire sends dew.
  - "Hear Azariah’s voice rise from the heart of trial: confession becomes trust; the furnace becomes a sanctuary."
  - "Feel the paradox touch your soul: purifying heat and consoling dew together fashion a heart for God."
ejaculatory_prayer: Holy Spirit, be fire to purify and dew to console.
colloquy: Lord, in my trials let Your Spirit burn away what is false and cool what is fearful, until my whole life becomes praise.
resolution: In a present difficulty, I pray the Prayer of Azariah (Daniel 3:24–45), uniting my trial to the hymn of the youths.
