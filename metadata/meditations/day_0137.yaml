meditative_points:
  - “Into Your hands I commend my spirit.” These are not words of defeat —
    but of complete trust. Jesus lets go — not in despair, but in perfect surrender.
  - The hands of the Father are not far. They are stretched out even now.
ejaculatory_prayer: Into Thy hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit.
colloquy: Speak to the Father as Christ did. Give Him your whole life again —
  without condition, without fear. Let the Cross teach you how to die
  before you die.
resolution: Today I will speak this prayer — “Into Thy hands…” —
  three times throughout the day, and mean it more deeply each time.
