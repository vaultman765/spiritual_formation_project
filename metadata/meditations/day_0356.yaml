meditative_points:
  - “Where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I in the midst of them.”
  - His Name gathers, unites, and brings His living presence to the Church.
  - "Enter the communion of prayer: Christ stands among His faithful."
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, be present in Your Church gathered in Your Name.
colloquy: Lord, let me never take lightly the gift of Your presence.
  In prayer with others, make me aware that You stand among us, unseen yet true.
resolution: I will consciously recall Christ’s presence whenever I pray with another today, saying His Name with reverence.
