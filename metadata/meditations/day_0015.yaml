  Lightning flashes. A trumpet sounds. The people tremble as the voice of God roars
  from the cloud.

meditative_points:
  - “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.” (Prov 9:10) — not dread, but
    reverent awareness of His majesty.
  - Israel trembled at Sinai not because God was cruel, but because His holiness was
    overwhelming.
  - Prayer begins not with comfort, but awe. Reverence is the gate into the presence
    of the living God.
ejaculatory_prayer: Teach me to begin every prayer with awe, O Lord.
colloquy: Lord, give me holy fear—not the fear that hides, but the awe that bows and adores. Let this fear strip me of arrogance and teach me wisdom.
resolution:
  Today I will examine whether I begin my prayer with reverence — and I
  will ask for the grace to fear rightly.
