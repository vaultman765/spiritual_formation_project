anchor_image: You are in Nazareth. The young Jesus bows His head in obedience as

meditative_points:
  - See Jesus — Lord of heaven and earth — obeying His Mother’s instruction with total humility.
  - Consider how He, who gave the Law, subjects Himself to the law of filial obedience.
  - "Let your soul rest in the paradox: divinity hidden in submission, glory veiled in Nazareth."
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, teach me to obey with love.
colloquy: Lord, I bow before You who bowed before Mary and Joseph.
  Grant me the grace to find You in humble submission, and to imitate Your obedience with joy.
resolution: I will perform one act of obedience today without delay, offering it to Christ.
