day_title: Christ Crowned with Thorns – Majesty in Mockery
anchor_image:
  '**Christ Crowned with Thorns** Jesus is seated, hands bound, draped in a purple robe.
  A crown of twisted thorns is pressed onto His head. Blood trickles down His face.
  A reed is shoved into His hand like a mock scepter. Soldiers jeer and bow in sarcasm.
  Yet He radiates quiet majesty in their mockery.'

meditative_points:
  - Christ accepts the crown of thorns — not in wrath, but in silence.
  - The King of Heaven is mocked with earthly symbols of power.
  - Every insult He received purifies the pride in my own heart.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, King crowned in thorns, rule in my heart.
colloquy: 'Jesus, mocked King, I often seek crowns of comfort and control.
  Teach me to wear the crown of thorns with You — not to be honored, but to love.'
resolution: Today I will resist one urge to seek praise — and silently offer it as a crown of thorns.
