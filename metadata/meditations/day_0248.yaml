meditative_points:
  - Paul speaks to you of counting all things as loss compared to the surpassing knowledge of Christ.
  - Recognize that true knowledge is not possession but union with Him.
  - See creation itself as pointing back to God, Who is its origin and end.
ejaculatory_prayer: Spirit of Knowledge, teach me to see all things in Your light.
colloquy: Lord, grant me knowledge that humbles me and leads me to love. May every fact of life direct me to You.
resolution: I will look at one aspect of creation today — a tree, the sky, the work of my hands — and thank God for it as His gift.
