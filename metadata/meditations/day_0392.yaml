meditative_points:
  - "“A grain of mustard seed.” Attend to the smallness — nearly weightless, almost unseen — and the promise within it."
  - "The seed is sown; roots take; a shrub rises beyond expectation."
  - "Birds come to nest in its branches — the little becomes shelter."
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, increase my faith.
colloquy: Lord, bless what is small in me and make it fruitful.
  Plant Your Kingdom in my littleness until it becomes a place of rest for others.
resolution: I will do one hidden act of charity today without announcing it or seeking notice.
