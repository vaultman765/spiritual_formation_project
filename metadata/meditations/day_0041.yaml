anchor_image: "**Christ Revealing His Sacred Heart in Glory** — You kneel before the risen Christ. His eyes are like fire and mercy.
  His hands are extended in blessing, and His robe gleams like light.
  But what draws your soul is His Heart — visible, radiant, pierced, encircled with thorns, and burning with love.
  It is not a wound of shame, but a throne of glory. He says nothing.
  He simply shows you the place where divine love became visible. Each title of the Litany is real here.
  You gaze at the Heart… and see eternity."

meditative_points:
  - The Hypostatic Union — divine and human perfectly one.
  - The Sacred Heart as both finite and infinite — beating with divine majesty.
  - The Word took on flesh to be pierced — for me.
ejaculatory_prayer: Heart of Jesus, one with the Eternal Word, possess me wholly.
colloquy: Jesus, Word made flesh, I cannot grasp the mystery — but I can kneel.
  May Your divine and human love pierce through my resistance. Let my poor heart be drawn into Yours.
resolution: Today I will reject the temptation to compartmentalize — and ask Christ to dwell fully in all areas of my life,
  even the hidden ones.
