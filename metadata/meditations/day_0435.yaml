meditative_points:
  - Human timing presses for quick justice; divine wisdom moves with a longer horizon.
  - The heart wavers between craving instant vindication and trusting God’s patient judgments.
ejaculatory_prayer: God of justice and mercy, teach me your timings.
colloquy: Lord, save me from simplifying your ways to fit my fears.
  Grant me a reverent patience before your judgments and a steadfast hope that does not demand signs.
resolution: Practice patience today. Offer the waiting as an act of trust rather than complaint.
