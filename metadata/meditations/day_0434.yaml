anchor_image: In the dim light of late afternoon, you lean toward Job as he rises from the ash heap.
  His eyes, wet with grief, look beyond the horizon as he speaks of a Redeemer who lives and whom he shall see with his own eyes.

meditative_points:
  - "The words rise from dust and sores into hope: a living Redeemer beyond the present ruin."
  - “With my own eyes” - the body, so wounded now, becomes the place of future beholding.
  - Job’s cry parts the veil of accusation and sets the heart toward a face-to-face encounter.
ejaculatory_prayer: “Living Redeemer, fix my eyes on you.”
colloquy: Jesus, you are the Redeemer Job longed for. In my wounds and losses, anchor me in the promise that I shall see you.
  Let this hope correct my fears and sweeten my endurance.
resolution: Memorize Job 19:25–27 and pray with it three times today - morning, midday, and evening.
