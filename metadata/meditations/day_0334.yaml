meditative_points:
  - "The devil dares Christ: “Throw Yourself down.” It is a temptation of pride — demanding proof, twisting Scripture."
  - Watch Christ refuse to tempt the Father. He trusts, He does not test.
  - Feel the abyss below the Temple’s height — the danger of demanding signs instead of faith.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, keep me from testing You.
colloquy: Lord, how often I demand proof of Your love. Forgive me. Give me trust that rests in You without signs or conditions.
resolution: Today I will accept a hidden task or unseen act of service, without looking for recognition.
