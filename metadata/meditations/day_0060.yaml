meditative_points:
  - You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek
  - Melchizedek offers bread and wine, prefiguring Christ
  - The priesthood of Christ is eternal, royal, and mysterious
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, true Priest and King, nourish me with Your eternal sacrifice.
colloquy:
  O Christ, the mystery of Melchizedek is fulfilled in You. You offer not
  animal sacrifice, but Bread and Wine — Your own Body and Blood. Let me recognize
  the glory of Your priesthood in every Mass, and honor the mystery You fulfill forever.
resolution:
  At Mass today, or in spiritual communion, I will consciously unite myself
  to Christ’s eternal priesthood made present on the altar.
