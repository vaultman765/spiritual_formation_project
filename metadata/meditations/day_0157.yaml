  - Sit with Jeremiah in darkness, feeling both abandonment and the quiet hope that remains in prayer.
  - Let the single beam of light remind you that God never forgets those who trust Him in affliction.

colloquy: Speak to God about any place of loneliness or abandonment in your life, and ask for steadfast faith.
