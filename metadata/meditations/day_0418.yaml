meditative_points:
  - Watch the rising sun pour fire through the furnace’s open air, a greater flame praising the Lord.
  - See the calm moon above — silent witness of night — offering its silver hymn to God.
  - Let the sun’s heat and the moon’s coolness remind you of God’s balance, His harmony in creation.

colloquy: O Christ, true Light, may I reflect Your radiance as the moon reflects the sun.
