meditative_points:
  - A woman clothed with the sun — crowned with twelve stars — a sign in Heaven.
  - Mary, full of grace, shares now in the fullness of her Son’s victory.
  - She is assumed body and soul — where she intercedes for us in glory.
ejaculatory_prayer: Queen Assumed into Heaven, pray for us.
colloquy: Look upward with the Church. Speak to Mary in her glory. Ask her to lift
  your heart heavenward.
resolution: Today, I will invoke Mary’s help in one area where I long to rise above
  earthly attachments.
