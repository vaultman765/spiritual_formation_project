meditative_points:
  - "Jesus says to me directly: ‘You cannot serve two masters.’"
  - The desire to cling to both God and worldly gain fractures the soul — one always
    prevails.
  - What I do not surrender will become my master.
ejaculatory_prayer: Lord, I choose You — not the things that pass away.
colloquy:
  Jesus, gentle Master, show me where I serve another. Reveal what still claims
  my loyalty — my comfort, security, approval. Let me choose You with my whole heart.
  I want no rival to Your reign in me.
resolution:
  Today I will let go of one unnecessary attachment and offer it to God
  in silence.
