day_title: Watchfulness and Readiness
anchor_image:
  It is evening in a small village. A household sleeps in peace. Suddenly,
  the door creaks open — a thief enters unnoticed. We see the danger. They do not.
  This is how sudden judgment comes.

meditative_points:
  - The Master returns at an unexpected hour. Blessed is the servant found watching.
  - Christ warns not with threats, but with love — urging me to live each moment ready
    to meet Him.
  - Judgment comes not as surprise to the faithful, but as fulfillment. Let me not slumber
    in sin.
ejaculatory_prayer: Lord, awaken me before You return.
colloquy:
  Tell Christ you desire to be awake when He comes. Ask for the grace to live
  this day — and every day — as though it were your last.
resolution:
  Today I will live one task — however small — with love and attention,
  as if Christ were watching.
