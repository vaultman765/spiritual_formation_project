meditative_points:
  - Mary’s eyes fixed on the Child as the shepherds depart
  - “She kept all these things…” — the flame hidden within her Heart
  - 'The silence of Mary at Bethlehem: love without words'
ejaculatory_prayer:
  Immaculate Heart of Mary, ponder with me the mysteries of your
  Son.
colloquy:
  O Mary, whose heart blazed silently in the night, teach me to keep the word
  of God in my heart. Help me to become recollected, still, and full of wonder before
  the mysteries of Christ. Let me imitate your interior gaze, which sees and loves
  even what cannot be spoken.
resolution:
  Today, I will pause for five minutes in complete silence, simply placing
  myself in the presence of God with Mary.
