meditative_points:
  - "A conscience laid bare: “My heart does not reproach me”"
  - "Integrity as light in the storm: the soul stands before God more than men."
ejaculatory_prayer: “Search me, O God, and know my heart.”
colloquy: Lord, you dwell in truth. Let my speech be simple and my heart undivided before you;
  keep me from self-deception and from judging by appearances.
resolution: Make one concrete act of truthfulness today
  (a needed apology, a clear admission, or a kept promise) without excuse or spin.
