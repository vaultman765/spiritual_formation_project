meditative_points:
  - The Spirit bears witness that you are God’s child, not by nature but by adoption through Christ.
  - Cry “Abba, Father” with the Church — the Trinity’s indwelling makes you heir with Christ.
  - Adoption is not mere title but true participation in divine life.
ejaculatory_prayer: Abba, Father, claim me as Your child.
colloquy: Lord, I thank You for the Spirit of adoption.
  Though unworthy, You have made me Your heir with Christ. Keep me faithful as Your child.
resolution: I will pray and reflect on the Our Father slowly today, aware that it is the Spirit who gives me the right to say, “Father.”
