meditative_points:
  - The shepherds kneeling in silence before the Christ Child
  - Mary watching their adoration, her Heart echoing their wonder
  - The poverty of the stable as the dwelling place of divine glory
ejaculatory_prayer: Immaculate Heart of Mary, lead me to adore your Son.
colloquy:
  O Mary, draw me close to the manger. Let me kneel beside you and the shepherds
  in silent adoration. Teach me to love the hidden Christ — poor, small, and humble
  — with a heart that burns like yours.
resolution:
  I will offer a moment of silent adoration today, imagining myself beside
  Mary and the shepherds at the manger.
