meditative_points:
  - The Lamb stands as though slain — in heaven
  - He is worthy to open the scroll because He was slain
  - The eternal liturgy of heaven centers on His priestly sacrifice
ejaculatory_prayer: Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, to receive all glory and honor.
colloquy:
  Jesus, Eternal Priest and Lamb of God, You are enthroned in the true sanctuary.
  The saints adore You for Your sacrifice. Let my heart join in that liturgy, even
  now. I offer You all that I am — in worship, in adoration, in joy. Worthy are You,
  forever and ever.
resolution:
  I will spend time in silent adoration today, contemplating the eternal
  priesthood of Christ glorified in heaven.
