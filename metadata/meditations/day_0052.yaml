anchor_image: "**Christ Revealing His Sacred Heart in Glory** — You kneel before the risen Christ. His eyes are like fire and mercy.
  His hands are extended in blessing, and His robe gleams like light.
  But what draws your soul is His Heart — visible, radiant, pierced, encircled with thorns, and burning with love.
  It is not a wound of shame, but a throne of glory. He says nothing.
  He simply shows you the place where divine love became visible. Each title of the Litany is real here.
  You gaze at the Heart… and see eternity."

meditative_points:
  - The Sacred Heart offered — not taken.
  - He was silent — and He was slain.
ejaculatory_prayer: Heart of Jesus, slain for my salvation, have mercy on me, a sinner.
colloquy: Jesus, Victim and Priest, how can I ever repay what You gave?
  Let me not rush past Your wounds — but rest in the silence of Your offering.
resolution: Today, I will accept one small suffering without complaint — in union with the Lamb.
