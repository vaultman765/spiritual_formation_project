meditative_points:
  - They placed a crown of thorns upon His head and mocked Him.
  - Behold the King of Suffering, clothed in purple, scorned by men.
  - Love accepts humiliation — Christ redeems even our pride through pain.
ejaculatory_prayer: O Crowned King of Love, reign in my heart.
colloquy:
  Speak to Christ the King. Kneel before Him who is mocked for your sake.
  Offer Him your pride and self-love.
resolution:
  Today, I will quietly accept a correction or embarrassment for love of
  Christ.
