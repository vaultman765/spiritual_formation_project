  - Feel the loneliness that comes when others do not understand your suffering.
  - Notice how Job holds to the truth of his experience, even when easy answers fail.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, grant me compassion for those who suffer in silence.
colloquy: Speak to Christ about times when you felt misunderstood in pain, and ask for a heart like His for others.
resolution: Today, I will offer patient listening to someone’s struggle rather than quick solutions.
