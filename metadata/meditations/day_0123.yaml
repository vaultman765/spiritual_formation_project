meditative_points:
  - "Jesus says: ‘If your eye is sound…’ — but what do I gaze upon each day?"
  - What I choose to behold either fills me with light or shadows my soul.
  - Purity of vision leads to simplicity of heart.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, purify the gaze of my soul.
colloquy: Lord, I look at many things that leave me anxious, distracted, or divided.
  Turn my eyes toward You. Let the lamp of my body be clear. Fill me with Your light
  — not the world’s noise.
resolution: I will fast from one visual distraction today, to guard the gaze of my
  heart.
