meditative_points:
  - The devil departs — but notice, Christ’s battle ends in consolation, not triumphalism.
  - Angels come quietly, ministering to Him in His weakness. The Father provides after fidelity.
  - Your obedience too will be met with consolation, often hidden, often angelic.
ejaculatory_prayer: Lord, send Your angels to strengthen me.
colloquy: Jesus, give me patience in trial. I do not seek visions or signs,
  but I trust You will sustain me — through angels, through grace, through hidden consolations.
resolution: I will call upon my guardian angel today and consciously entrust myself to his care.
