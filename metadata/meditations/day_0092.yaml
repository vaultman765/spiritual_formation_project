meditative_points:
  - The stone was rolled away — not to let Christ out, but to let us see He is risen.
  - He appeared to Mary Magdalene — calling her by name.
  - 'Christ is risen: death has no more power. Rejoice in the dawn of eternal life.'
ejaculatory_prayer: Risen Lord, awaken my heart to Your eternal light.
colloquy:
  Come to the tomb with Mary. Hear Him speak your name. Let joy overcome fear
  and run to tell others.
resolution:
  Today, I will live in the joy of the Resurrection by choosing gratitude
  and hope.
