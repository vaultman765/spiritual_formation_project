meditative_points:
  - “He entrusted to them his property.” Receive gifts as a charge from the King.
  - “Well done, good and faithful servant.” Let fidelity, not fear, guide your work.
  - “I was afraid and went and hid your talent.” Name the fear that buries grace.
ejaculatory_prayer: Lord, make me faithful with what You entrust.
colloquy: Jesus, give me courage to trade the gifts You’ve given. Save me from sterile fear; lead me into fruitful fidelity.
resolution: I will identify one concrete gift and put it to use today for someone’s good in Your name.
