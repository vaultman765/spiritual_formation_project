meditative_points:
  - The sight of untroubled houses makes the question sharper in your chest.
  - Job’s honesty before God becomes a form of worship—truth spoken in the presence of Mystery.
  - "A turning of the gaze: from comparing lots to seeking the God who is “my portion forever.”"
ejaculatory_prayer: “Whom have I in heaven but you?”
colloquy: Father, I confess the sting I feel when the unjust prosper. Purify my vision;
  let my portion be you. Lead me into the sanctuary where your end of things is seen.
resolution: Fast from comparison today. Avoid checking one metric or feed that fuels envy and replace
  it with a brief thanksgiving for a gift you already have.
