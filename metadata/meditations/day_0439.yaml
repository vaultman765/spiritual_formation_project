day_title: Why Do the Wicked Seem Secure?
anchor_image: From a ridge you and Job watch caravans move undisturbed, estates humming with life below.
  His voice is steady but sorrowful as he names the violence the poor endure and the
  untroubled sleep of oppressors.

meditative_points:
  - "The contrast pierces: hidden crimes below; a sky that says nothing—for now."
  - Naming injustice before God becomes intercession, not bitterness.
  - "Faith leans into the promise: the vision hastens to fulfillment—wait for it."
ejaculatory_prayer: “God of the poor, let your justice dawn.”
colloquy: Father, keep my heart from envy and my hands from violence.
  Teach me to suffer evil with patience and to do good with courage until your justice is revealed.
resolution: Perform one concrete work of mercy today (alms, listening to someone burdened, or helping an overlooked person).
