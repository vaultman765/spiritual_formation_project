anchor_image: Christ Crowned with Thorns** Jesus is seated, hands bound, draped in
  a purple robe. A crown of twisted thorns is pressed onto His head. Blood trickles
  down His face. A reed is shoved into His hand like a mock scepter. Soldiers jeer
  and bow in sarcasm. Yet He radiates quiet majesty in their mockery.
