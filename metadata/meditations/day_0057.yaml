meditative_points:
  - Christ enters the sanctuary with His own Blood
  - His sacrifice is offered once for all, not repeatedly
  - This Blood purifies the conscience to serve the living God
ejaculatory_prayer:
  Jesus, You offered Yourself once for all — purify my heart by
  Your Blood.
colloquy:
  Lord Jesus, what the high priests could never accomplish year after year,
  You have done once and forever. You did not bring the blood of animals, but Your
  own — for me. I adore You for this final offering. Let my life be a continual act
  of thanksgiving for Your one eternal sacrifice.
resolution:
  I will spend time in silent gratitude today, recalling that I am redeemed
  not by effort or repetition, but by the one perfect offering of Christ on the Cross.
