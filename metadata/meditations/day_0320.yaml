meditative_points:
  - Watch Mary, her prayer offered in quietness, without show or noise.
  - See the Child Jesus gazing at her, learning by imitation the value of silent recollection.
  - Realize that prayer in silence sanctifies not only the heart, but the whole home.
ejaculatory_prayer: Mother Mary, teach me to pray in silence.
colloquy: Lord, let my prayer imitate the stillness of Your Mother, who treasured all things quietly in her heart.
resolution: I will pray one decade of the Rosary today in silence, without rushing, imitating Mary’s stillness.
