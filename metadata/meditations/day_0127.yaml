  — only devotion.

meditative_points:
  - The hands that shaped stars now plane rough cedar in a small village.
  - There is no lesser work in Nazareth — every action becomes praise.
  - Jesus labors not to build chairs — but to redeem toil itself.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, sanctifier of labor, let my hands work in silence for You.
colloquy:
  Lord, how hidden You were. How patient. How silent. Teach me to love quiet
  work. Sanctify my labor — however small — and let it unite me to Yours.
resolution:
  I will complete my next task today in total silence, with intention toward
  God.
