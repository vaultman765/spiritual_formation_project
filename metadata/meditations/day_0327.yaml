meditative_points:
  - "Watch Jesus obeying Joseph’s instruction at the workbench: cutting, sanding, shaping wood."
  - See His obedience transfigure daily labor into prayer and offering to the Father.
  - Let your heart find in ordinary work the path of holiness, when done with obedient love.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, sanctify my work through obedience.
colloquy: Lord, may I learn to unite my labor with Yours in Nazareth.
  Give me the grace to obey joyfully in the smallest tasks, offering them for love of You.
resolution: I will offer today’s work — however small — as an act of obedience to God.
