meditative_points:
  - “The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the Body of Christ?”
  - One bread makes one body—gathered at the altar beneath the Cross.
  - “The cup of blessing… a participation in the Blood of Christ.”
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, make us one Body in Your Blood.
colloquy: Lord, let communion with Your Body and Blood bind me to Your Church.
  Heal division in me and around me; draw us into the unity You willed from the Cross.
resolution: I will make an act of spiritual communion today, praying for deeper unity in the Church.
