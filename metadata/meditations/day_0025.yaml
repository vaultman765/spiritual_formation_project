anchor_image:
  "**The Road Home** — You walk a long dirt path alone, torn and stained by your sins.
  In the distance, the Father waits — not seated, but running. His arms are open before you even speak.
  He throws His cloak over your shame and calls for a feast."

meditative_points:
  - "'While he was still a long way off, his father saw him and had compassion…' (v. 20) — God’s mercy does not wait for perfection.
    The turn itself awakens His compassion."
  - "The prodigal prepares a speech — but the Father interrupts with an embrace. Conversion is not about eloquence; it is about return."
  - "The robe, the ring, the feast — these are not rewards for holiness. They are gifts for the one who comes home hungry."
ejaculatory_prayer: Father, I am not worthy to be called Your child — but I come to You.
colloquy:
  Speak to the Father not as a stranger, but as one returning from exile. Let the words of your confession be simple and honest.
  Do not defend yourself. Just walk to Him. He is already running.
resolution:
  Today, recall a time when you felt far from God — and how He welcomed you back.
  Let that memory stir a return to confession or prayer.
