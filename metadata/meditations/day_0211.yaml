meditative_points:
  - "Hear Christ’s promise to you: “My flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.”"
  - Sense the shock of the crowd — yet remain, believing His word of eternal life.
  - Realize that here He prepares the gift of His abiding Presence in the Eucharist.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, Bread of Life, strengthen my faith.
colloquy: Lord, Your words are spirit and life, even when they challenge my understanding. Give me a heart that believes and clings to You.
resolution: I will spend a few minutes today in thanksgiving after Communion, recalling that I have received the Bread of Life Himself.
