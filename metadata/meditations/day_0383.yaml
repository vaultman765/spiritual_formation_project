meditative_points:
  - Watch Christ welcome the children, blessing their littleness as the way of the Kingdom.
  - The childlike way is hidden yet universal — humility, trust, and love form its road.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, teach me the little way of love.
colloquy: Lord, let me walk the path of littleness with joy. As You blessed the children, bless my desire to be small and wholly Yours.
resolution: I will make one act of hidden love today, unseen by others but offered to Christ with simplicity.
