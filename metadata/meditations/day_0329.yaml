meditative_points:
  - "Hear Christ: “My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me.” Even in Nazareth, this was His hidden nourishment."
  - Watch Him conform each small action to the will of the Father.
  - "Let your soul desire this union: obedience as daily bread, obedience as delight."
ejaculatory_prayer: Father, let Your will be my food.
colloquy: Lord Jesus, make me hunger for the Father’s will as You did.
  Transform my resistance into readiness, and my reluctance into joy.
resolution: I will pray “Thy will be done” slowly and deliberately three times today, offering myself to God’s plan.
