anchor_image: "**Christ Revealing His Sacred Heart in Glory** — You kneel before the risen Christ. His eyes are like fire and mercy. His hands are extended in blessing, and His robe gleams like light. But what draws your soul is His Heart — visible, radiant, pierced, encircled with thorns, and burning with love. It is not a wound of shame, but a throne of glory. He says nothing. He simply shows you the place where divine love became visible. Each title of the Litany is real here. You gaze at the Heart… and see eternity."

meditative_points:
  - The King wears a crown of insult
  - The Sacred Heart bears humiliation that I fear to face
ejaculatory_prayer: Heart of Jesus, mocked and majestic, I adore You in Your abasement.
colloquy: Jesus, You were shamed so I could be healed. Let me not turn away from Your crown of thorns. Let me kneel where the world mocked — and adore.
resolution: Today I will accept one moment of misunderstanding or mockery for His sake — without defending myself.
