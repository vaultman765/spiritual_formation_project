day_title: Eliphaz Speaks — Counsel and Its Limits
anchor_image: Dawn on the ash heap. The three friends sit facing Job. One rises - Eliphaz - his cloak gathered,
  voice steady, ready to offer wisdom to the suffering just.

meditative_points:
  - Listen as Eliphaz speaks true things yet misses the man before him; feel the gap between formula and presence.
  - Watch Job’s face as counsel turns into accusation; sense how pain is aggravated by neat answers.
  - Remain in the tension between human wisdom and divine mystery; let the unmastered question stay before God.
ejaculatory_prayer: Lord, give me a listening heart.
colloquy: Jesus, keep me from speaking truths without love.
  Teach me to stand with the suffering and to wait with You before the mystery.
resolution: When someone shares a burden today, resist quick advice; offer attentive presence and a prayer instead.
