  "**Christ Revealing His Sacred Heart in Glory** — You kneel before the risen Christ. His eyes are like fire and mercy.
  His hands are extended in blessing, and His robe gleams like light.
  But what draws your soul is His Heart — visible, radiant, pierced, encircled with thorns, and burning with love.
  It is not a wound of shame, but a throne of glory. He says nothing.
  He simply shows you the place where divine love became visible. Each title of the Litany is real here.
  You gaze at the Heart… and see eternity."

meditative_points:
  - The patience of Jesus with me is longer than my longest failure
  - He delays not to punish, but to save
ejaculatory_prayer: Heart of Jesus, patient and merciful, wait for me. I’m coming.
colloquy:
  Jesus, I run from Your mercy because I think I must earn it. But You wait — not with anger, but with open arms.
  Teach me that repentance is not groveling but coming home.
resolution: 'Today, I will not run from His mercy — but return at once when I fall, saying only: "Have mercy, Lord."'
