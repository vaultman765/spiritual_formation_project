meditative_points:
  - "Hear Christ say to you: “My grace is sufficient for you.” Weakness becomes the place where divine strength shines."
  - Thérèse teaches confidence not in herself but in the Father’s mercy that lifts the little soul.
  - Spiritual childhood rejoices to be weak, for then the Father shows His strength.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, be my strength in weakness.
colloquy: Lord, I confess my frailty and limits. Let me not despair in them but glory in them, for Your power is made perfect there.
resolution: Today I will accept a small humiliation or limitation with gratitude, as a place for Christ’s power to dwell.
