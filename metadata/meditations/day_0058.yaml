meditative_points:
  - Christ holds His priesthood permanently because He remains forever
  - He always lives to make intercession for us
  - His one offering was perfect and final — now He reigns as eternal mediator
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, my Eternal High Priest, intercede for me now and forever.
colloquy:
  'Lord Jesus, no other priest remains forever — but You do. Yours is not
  a passing role, but a permanent mission: to intercede for me before the Father.
  Let this truth awaken my trust. When I feel forgotten, remind me that You are speaking
  my name eternally in heaven.'
resolution:
  I will renew my confidence in prayer today, remembering that Christ always
  intercedes for me, not just in history but in this very moment.
