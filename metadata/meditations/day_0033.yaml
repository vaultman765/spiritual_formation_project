day_title: Christ Carries the Cross – The Meeting with St. Veronica
anchor_image: "**Christ Carries the Cross** Bruised and bleeding, Jesus takes up the heavy beam. The road is uneven.
  He stumbles. Simon of Cyrene is pulled from the crowd to help. St. Veronica emerges and presses a cloth to His face.
  He looks at her — the cloth bears His image. He continues forward, one step at a time."

meditative_points:
  - Christ’s suffering is public — yet He carries it without resentment.
  - St. Veronica’s act was small, hidden, and deeply personal.
  - Christ gave her His image — what do I offer Him?
ejaculatory_prayer: O Christ bearing the Cross, impress Your image on my heart.
colloquy: "Jesus, I want to be like St. Veronica — not solving, not preaching, but present.
  Let me offer a veil, a silence, a prayer… and receive Your Face in return."
resolution: Today I will console Christ by offering one quiet act of compassion — unseen, unpraised, but full of love.
