day_title: Mary’s Silent Suffering
anchor_image: You are standing with Mary at the foot of the Cross. She gazes upon her Son in agony, hears His words,
  and unites her heart to His sacrifice. John is beside her, and the soldiers are near. Simeon’s prophecy — that a
  sword would pierce her soul — is now fulfilled.

meditative_points:
  - Watch Mary’s silence — she speaks no word, yet her sorrow cries out to heaven.
  - Feel the sword of sorrow piercing her soul as she gazes on her crucified Son.
  - Learn from her to suffer without complaint, in pure union with Christ’s will.
ejaculatory_prayer: O Mary, teach me holy silence at the Cross.
colloquy: Mother, your silence is more eloquent than words. Let me share in your quiet faith,
  your hidden endurance, and your love joined to Jesus.
resolution: Today I will keep a period of silent prayer, uniting my heart to Mary’s silence beneath the Cross.
