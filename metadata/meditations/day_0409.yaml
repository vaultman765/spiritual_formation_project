meditative_points:
  - "Jesus speaks to you: “Everyone who looks… with lust has already committed adultery in the heart.”"
  - “If your right eye causes you to sin…” Feel the urgency of decisive renunciation for love of Him.
  - Look into His gaze that purifies, and desire a single, undivided heart.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, purify my heart.
colloquy: Lord, I bring You my disordered desires. Cleanse my heart, strengthen my will, and teach me to love with reverence and truth.
resolution: I will practice custody of the eyes today in the first moment of temptation and turn
  immediately to prayer (three Hail Marys), removing any near occasion within my control.
