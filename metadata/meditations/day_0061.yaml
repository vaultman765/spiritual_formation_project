meditative_points:
  - You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood
  - Christ shares His priesthood with His Body, the Church
  - Every baptized soul is called to offer spiritual sacrifices
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, help me live as a priestly soul in union with You.
colloquy:
  Lord, You have made me a priest in Your image — not by ordination, but by
  Baptism. Let me never forget the dignity of this call. Teach me to offer my day,
  my sufferings, my praise — all united to Your one offering. I want to live as a
  living sacrifice to You.
resolution:
  Today I will make a spiritual offering of some small suffering or task,
  uniting it to Christ’s priesthood with intention.
