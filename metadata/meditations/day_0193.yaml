meditative_points:
  - "Hear Jesus speak: 'Soul of Christ, sanctify me.' Let these words echo in your
    own soul."
  - Gaze upon His face and know that His soul is pure, wounded, and burning with love
    for you.
  - "Ask: what must be purged in you to be sanctified by His soul?"
ejaculatory_prayer: Soul of Christ, make me holy and yours alone.
colloquy: Speak to Jesus about the sanctification you desire. Confess the areas you
  hold back. Ask Him to possess and purify your soul entirely.
resolution: I will make one act of self-denial today to cooperate with Christ’s sanctification
  of my soul.
