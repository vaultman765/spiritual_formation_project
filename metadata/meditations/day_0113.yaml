meditative_points:
  - The crowds dissapear and Christ speaks directly to you - “Be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.”
  - 'Jesus speaks directly to you: "If you love those who love you, what reward will you get?"'
ejaculatory_prayer:
  Jesus, show me the way to perfection — not by ambition, but by
  following You.
colloquy:
  Lord, I hear Your words on the mount — not distant thunder, but an intimate
  summons. You do not command as a stranger; You call as the Beloved. Show me how
  to walk this way of perfection not by my strength, but in imitation of You. Make
  me poor in spirit, pure in heart, and docile to Your will.
resolution:
  Today I will examine which of the three counsels I most resist — and ask
  for grace to desire it.
