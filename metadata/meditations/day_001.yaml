meditative_points:
- Jesus stoops to wash the feet of His disciples — even of Judas.
- 'Love is not a sentiment but a command: ''You also ought to wash one another’s feet.'''
- The measure of our love for God is revealed by how we serve the least of our brothers.
ejaculatory_prayer: Lord, teach me to love as You love.
colloquy: 'Jesus, my Master and Lord, You humbled Yourself to wash the feet of sinful
  men.

  Teach me not to seek honor but to serve. Let me love not in word only, but in deed.

  Transform my pride into humility, my comfort-seeking into generosity.

  Help me to see You in those around me — and to kneel, like You, in love.'
resolution: Today I will do one hidden act of service for someone I find difficult
  to love.
