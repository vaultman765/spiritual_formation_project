meditative_points:
  - See the young Christ, absorbed in silence, learning more from stillness than words could teach.
  - Hear the quiet rhythm of Joseph’s work — even this becomes a school of contemplation for Jesus.
  - Let yourself be present in that hush, where silence becomes communion with God.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, teach me the wisdom of silence.
colloquy: Lord, like You, I long to learn in silence.
  Let me be attentive, not only to words, but to the stillness in which the Father speaks.
resolution: Today I will embrace a moment of silence, turning off distractions, to be present with God in stillness.
