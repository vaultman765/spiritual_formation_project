  Job sits in ashes outside the ruins of his home. Torn garments hang from his shoulders. He is silent, eyes fixed on the ground,
  with all that he once loved now lost.

meditative_points:
  - Sit with Job in the silence of loss, feeling the emptiness and bewilderment of his suffering.
  - Notice how he does not curse God, but brings his pain into God’s presence, even when no answers come.
ejaculatory_prayer: Lord, help me to trust You even in the silence of suffering.
colloquy: Speak to God about your own losses and uncertainties, asking for the grace to remain faithful as Job did.
resolution: Today, I will quietly surrender one sorrow to God without demanding an answer.
