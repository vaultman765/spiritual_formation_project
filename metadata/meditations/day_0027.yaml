meditative_points:
  - "'Blessed is the one whose transgression is forgiven…' (v. 1) — There is a joy that does not shout.
    It rests quietly in the knowledge of being loved again."
  - "The soul who confesses and receives absolution carries a secret peace the world cannot steal. It is not pride —
    it is the fruit of being healed."
  - "True contrition ends not in sorrow but in rejoicing. Heaven itself shares in this joy —
    'there is more joy in Heaven over one sinner who repents…'"
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, my joy is in Your mercy.
colloquy: Rest your soul before the Father who has forgiven you. Let yourself feel the quiet joy of reconciliation.
  Speak to Him not as a debtor, but as a beloved child — restored, embraced, held.
resolution: Today, live gently. Let your actions reflect interior peace.
  Speak with kindness, move without haste, and give thanks for mercy received.
