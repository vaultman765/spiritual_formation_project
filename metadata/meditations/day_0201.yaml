meditative_points:
  - Watch Christ stand unwavering before the devil’s temptations. He is hungry, tired, and alone — yet perfectly faithful.
  - "Hear His command: “Begone, Satan!” It is not a plea, but divine authority over evil."
  - In Him, all victory is won. In Him, you too can withstand the enemy’s lies and snares.
ejaculatory_prayer: Deliver me from evil, Jesus.
colloquy: O Lord, You conquered the tempter not with power, but obedience. In my hour of trial, be my strength.
  Defend me from the one who prowls like a lion.
resolution: I will reject temptations to sin immediately today, invoking Christ’s name and turning to Him for defense.
