meditative_points:
  - “And the Word was made flesh.”
  - In Mary’s womb, eternity touches time. The Word who spoke creation now enters it.
  - The flesh of Christ is not appearance — it is the permanent dwelling of God with
    man.
ejaculatory_prayer: Word made flesh, dwell in me as You dwelt in Mary.
colloquy:
  Jesus, Eternal Word, You did not cling to equality with God but took flesh
  for my salvation. Let my soul tremble before this mystery — not with fear, but with
  reverent awe. May I love You in Your humanity and find You in the Eucharist, in
  the womb of Mary, in the silence of Your humility.
resolution:
  I will make an act of reverence today before an image of Christ — truly
  God, truly man.
