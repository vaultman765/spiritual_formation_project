meditative_points:
  - Notice how sin draws the soul downward with false delight, while grace stirs compunction and repentance.
  - The beginner feels the clash between flesh and Spirit — the two paths opening before them.
  - God gently leads toward virtue, while the enemy agitates with discouragement or allurements.
ejaculatory_prayer: "Holy Spirit, teach me to walk by You and not by the flesh."
colloquy: Lord, I see the war within me. Give me the courage to choose the Spirit’s path and to resist the deceits of the enemy.
resolution: Identify one small temptation today and deliberately resist it, calling on the Spirit for help.
