meditative_points:
  - The Word pierces “to the division of soul and spirit”
  - Each sin of word, thought, and deed flashes before His light, demanding acknowledgment.
  - Nothing is hidden; every careless word and every selfish act is laid bare before His love.
ejaculatory_prayer: “Jesus, have mercy on my sins of thought, word, and deed.”
colloquy: Jesus, I cannot hide from Your truth. Show me the places where I failed to love You and my neighbor,
  and let my sorrow bring me closer to Your mercy.
resolution: I will make a concrete confession to You in prayer today,
  preparing my heart for and attending sacramental confession if needed.
