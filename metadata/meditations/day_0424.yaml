anchor_image: You sit on the ash heap outside the city with Job; the wind is still, the city walls in the distance.
  Job’s torn cloak clings to him; his friends have come and fall silent in grief beside him.

meditative_points:
  - See Job fall to the ground, tear his mantle, and bless the Name - sorrow and adoration held together in one breath.
  - Sit within the seven days of silence; hear only the dust, the breathing of friends, and the unspoken question before God.
ejaculatory_prayer: Blessed be the Name of the Lord, now and forever.
colloquy: Lord, You give and You take away. Hold my heart within Your will when I cannot understand Your ways.
  Teach me to worship in the dust.
resolution: Accept today’s first contradiction without complaint; make a quiet act of praise in the moment it stings.
