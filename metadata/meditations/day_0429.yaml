meditative_points:
  - Hear Job confess God’s greatness and his own smallness; feel the distance between creature and Creator widen like a sky at dusk.
  - Linger on Job’s yearning for an Arbiter who could lay a hand on both God and man.
  - Sense the ache of innocence seeking a face—someone to plead, to explain, to bridge the gulf.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, merciful High Priest, be my Advocate before the Father.
colloquy: Lord Christ, You know our frame and our fear. Draw near to my weakness; let Your voice speak my cause in the courts of heaven.
resolution: Approach God through Christ today - pray a short passage from Hebrews 4:14–16 aloud as your access to the Father.
