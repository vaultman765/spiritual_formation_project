meditative_points:
  - Hear the false accusations hurled against Christ; He answers not a word.
  - See His patience as strength, not weakness — serene endurance for love of the Father.
  - Desire to imitate His silence in trials and misunderstandings.
ejaculatory_prayer: O Jesus, meek and patient, teach me to endure in silence.
colloquy: Lord, You bore false accusations without complaint. I confess my impatience in small trials.
  Give me a share of Your peace in suffering.
resolution: Today I will accept one unjust word or inconvenience without protest, offering it to Christ in silence.
