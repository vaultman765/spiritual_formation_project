meditative_points:
  - Grasp the shining sword of the Spirit — the Word of God — burning with divine fire.
  - Recall how Christ in the desert defeated the enemy with “It is written…” — Scripture wielded as weapon.
  - Desire to know and love God’s Word so it becomes alive in your lips and heart.
ejaculatory_prayer: Word of God, be my strength.
colloquy: Holy Spirit, wield Your sword through me. Cut away falsehood and pierce my soul with truth.
resolution: I will memorize and carry one verse of Scripture today as a living weapon of the Spirit.
