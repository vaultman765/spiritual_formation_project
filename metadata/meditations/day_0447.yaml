meditative_points:
  - You feel the heaviness of David’s guilt, “a burden too heavy to bear,” pressing into your soul.
  - You witness friends withdrawing and enemies plotting, isolation deepening the pain of sin.
  - "You turn with David to God alone: “Do not forsake me, O Lord, my God.”"
ejaculatory_prayer: “Do not forsake me, O Lord, my God.”
colloquy: Lord, when sin isolates me, do not let me despair. Draw near, lift my burden, and be my salvation.
resolution: I will pray “Do not forsake me, O Lord” whenever I feel weighed down today.
