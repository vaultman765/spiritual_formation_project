meditative_points:
  - Christ's final breath was not taken — it was given.
  - He did not cling to life — He gave it back to the Father.
  - His surrender is the key to my freedom.
ejaculatory_prayer: Into Your hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit.
colloquy: Jesus, You gave everything — even Your last breath — in love. Help me to die to self today, and to trust that in surrender, I find life.
resolution: Today I will surrender one attachment, fear, or distraction — and make it a prayer of trust.
