anchor_image: The Crucified Christ (Face) — You gaze upon the face of Christ crucified.
  His eyes are closed, His head bowed beneath the crown of thorns. From this suffering Face shines infinite love.
  Every wound speaks the truth of God’s heart.

meditative_points:
  - "“God is love: His very being is love.”"
  - “Whoever loves has been born of God and knows God.”
  - The origin of love is not our effort, but God’s essence.
ejaculatory_prayer: God of love, let me receive You before I try to respond.
colloquy: Father, I believe You are love. But I forget this when I feel unworthy.
  Remind me that love does not begin with me — it begins with You.
resolution: Today, I will pause before I act — and receive love from God in silence before I offer it to anyone else.
