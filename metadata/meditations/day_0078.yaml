meditative_points:
  - Gabriel speaks; Mary listens with holy fear and trust
  - The Holy Spirit shall overshadow her — and she consents
  - Her 'Fiat' echoes through every generation
ejaculatory_prayer: Be it done to me according to thy word.
colloquy:
  O Mary, help me to say yes to God with the same trust you had. When I do
  not understand, help me surrender. When I fear, teach me to believe.
resolution: Today I will say yes to God's will in one small hidden moment.
