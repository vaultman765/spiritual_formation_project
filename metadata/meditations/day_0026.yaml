anchor_image: "**The Kneeling Soul** — You kneel in a dimly lit confessional.
  A curtain veils the priest, but through it speaks the mercy of Christ.
  You whisper your sins into the silence, and from beyond the veil comes a voice: 'Go in peace.'"

meditative_points:
  - "'Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven…' (v. 22–23) — Christ Himself established this sacrament.
    His mercy is not abstract — it is spoken aloud."
  - "The priest hears, but Christ absolves. The curtain does not conceal judgment, but reveals humility — yours, and His."
  - "The words of absolution are not merely formula — they are resurrection. In the silence, a dead soul rises."
ejaculatory_prayer: O Jesus, I believe that You forgive through Your Church.
colloquy:
  Speak to Christ present in the confessional. Tell Him your fears about going, your shame, your need.
  Ask Him to strengthen your trust in this sacrament. Let your soul kneel before Him in spirit now —
  even if you have not yet gone.
resolution:
  Make a firm plan today to go to confession — set the day, the time, and the place.
  Prepare now, and trust that He will meet you there.
