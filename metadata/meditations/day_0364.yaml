meditative_points:
  - Watch the merchant weigh the pearl—notice how lesser goods fade when the one thing necessary appears.
  - Hear Jesus ask softly, “What will you sell today so you can truly have Me?”
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, my Treasure and my Pearl—be my one thing.
colloquy: Lord, I want to choose You with delight, not half-measures. Free me from divided loves.
  Show me what to relinquish, and give me the joy that makes surrender easy. Possess my heart completely.
resolution: Make one joyful renunciation today.
