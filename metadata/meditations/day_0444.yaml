day_title: “Out of the Whirlwind” — Seeing and Surrender
anchor_image: The whirlwind descends. Dust and light coil as the Voice fills the air—sea’s boundary,
  dawn’s cords, mountain goats, Orion. Job kneels, hand over mouth; the world becomes temple.

meditative_points:
  - Creation speaks—questions like thunder unseat every small image of God.
  - “I had heard of you… but now my eye sees you”—knowledge yields to encounter.
  - "Ashes fall from Job’s garments as mercy restores: awe flowers into peace."
ejaculatory_prayer: “Speak, Lord, and let my soul live.”
colloquy: Almighty God, your grandeur makes me small and free.
  I surrender my arguments and receive your mercy; let wonder be the law of my heart.
resolution: Pray a short Te Deum or offer a decade of the Rosary in thanksgiving for God’s majesty and mercy.
