meditative_points:
  - “Pray for us sinners…” — the Virgin Mother stands beside us in our misery, not apart
    from it.
  - She is Advocate, not by power of her own, but because her Son wills her to intercede.
ejaculatory_prayer: O Mary, my Mother and Advocate, be with me in the hour of my death.
colloquy:
  Blessed Mother, who held God in your arms and holds sinners in your heart,
  pray for me today and at the moment of my dying. Do not leave me in that final hour.
  Let me breathe your name with my last breath.
resolution:
  I will entrust one soul to Mary's intercession today, especially someone
  near death or in grave need.
