meditative_points:
  - “And dwelt among us.” The eternal Word did not merely visit — He remained, He tabernacled
    among His people.
  - The God who could not be seen now walks among us, veiled in humility.
ejaculatory_prayer: O Word Incarnate, remain in me as You remained among us.
colloquy: Lord Jesus, You did not remain distant — You came to dwell among sinners.
  Make my heart a worthy dwelling place for You. May I never forget Your nearness,
  Your humanity, and Your desire to be with me.
resolution: I will spend 5 minutes today in silent awareness of Christ's real presence
  with me.
