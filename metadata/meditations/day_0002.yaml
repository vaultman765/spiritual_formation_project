anchor_image:
  The Crucified Christ (Face) — You gaze upon the face of Christ crucified.
  His eyes are closed, His head bowed beneath the crown of thorns. From this suffering Face shines infinite love.
  Every wound speaks the truth of God’s heart.

meditative_points:
  - “My soul thirsts for You… as in a dry and weary land.” (Ps 63:1)
  - “The measure of our love for God is to love Him without measure.” – St. Bernard
  - Love is not mere duty — it is longing, hunger, ache for God.
ejaculatory_prayer: O God, my soul thirsts for You alone.
colloquy:
  Lord, stir in me a holy longing. Let my thirst for You grow deeper than
  my thirst for approval, comfort, or control.
resolution:
  Today, I will offer every moment of restlessness as a prayer — letting
  it become desire for God, not distraction.
