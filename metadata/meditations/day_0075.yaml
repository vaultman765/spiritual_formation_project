meditative_points:
  - She lived every day with the knowledge of the coming Passion
  - Her Heart offered daily what her arms once held
  - Her suffering was hidden — but constant, total, and united to Christ
ejaculatory_prayer: Immaculate Heart of Mary, teach me to suffer with Christ.
colloquy:
  O Mary, hidden flame of suffering, teach me to suffer silently and with
  love. Let me not waste pain but offer it with you. May I live in union with the
  pierced Heart that loved perfectly.
resolution:
  Today I will offer a hidden sorrow for someone else’s good, asking Mary
  to make it fruitful.
