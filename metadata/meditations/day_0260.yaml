meditative_points:
  - Watch the soul seized by God in rapture, lifted beyond its own powers.
  - Feel how ecstasies are both sweetness and purification, stripping away self-love.
  - Desire to let God’s love carry you where you cannot go by your own strength.
ejaculatory_prayer: Lord, draw me beyond myself into Your love.
colloquy: O God, I am powerless to reach You — lift me in Your Spirit, purify me through love alone.
resolution: I will spend a few minutes today yielding quietly to God, asking Him to work freely in me.
