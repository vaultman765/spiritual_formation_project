meditative_points:
  - See the soldier pierce Christ’s side, and from it flow blood and water.
  - Contemplate this stream as the fountain of the Church’s life.
  - Recognize in it both baptism and Eucharist, sacraments that give birth to God’s people.
ejaculatory_prayer: From Your side, O Lord, bring forth life in me.
colloquy: O Jesus, let me never forget that the Church flows from Your pierced Heart.
  May I live always from the sacraments that spring from You.
resolution: I will renew my baptismal promises briefly today, making the Sign of the Cross with gratitude.
