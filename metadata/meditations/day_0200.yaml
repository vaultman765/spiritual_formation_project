anchor_image: You are with Peter on the stormy sea. The wind howls and waves rise,
  but Christ walks toward you. You falter, sinking — but His hand is already reaching
  for yours.

meditative_points:
  - Feel the pull of the waters — fear, sin, pride — yet see Christ standing firm, eyes
    locked on you.
  - "Hear His words: 'Why did you doubt?' They are not rebuke, but invitation to deeper
    faith."
  - Cling to His hand. Nothing — not height, nor depth, nor any creature — can separate
    you if you hold fast.
ejaculatory_prayer: Suffer me not to be separated from You.
colloquy: Lord, I am weak, but You are strong. When I drift, call me. When I sink,
  lift me. Let nothing — not fear, not temptation, not death — tear me from Your Heart.
resolution: "Today I will return to Christ immediately whenever I feel myself drifting
  — through prayer, even a whisper: 'Hold me, Jesus.'"
