anchor_image: '**The Burial of Christ** The body of Jesus is taken down.
  Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea wrap Him in linen, anoint Him with myrrh. Mary touches His face one last time.
  The tomb is near. They roll the stone across the entrance. Stillness covers everything.'

meditative_points:
  - Christ’s body is laid in the tomb — but not in defeat.
  - Holy Saturday is not absence, but hidden fruitfulness.
  - Even in death, the Word is at work.
ejaculatory_prayer: Lord, even in silence, I believe You are working.
colloquy: Jesus, as You rested in the tomb, teach me to wait in trust. Let me not rush Your timing, but abide with You in stillness.
resolution: Today I will embrace a moment of quiet — trusting that God acts in the hidden places of my heart.
