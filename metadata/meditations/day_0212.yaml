anchor_image: You are in the Upper Room on the night of the Last Supper. Jesus takes bread, blesses it,
  breaks it, and gives it to His disciples, saying, “This is My Body.” Then He takes the chalice and
  declares, “This is My Blood of the covenant.”

meditative_points:
  - See Christ take bread into His hands and declare it to be His very Body.
  - Hear His voice as He gives the chalice of His Blood — the covenant sealed in sacrifice.
  - Realize that here the Sacrament of His abiding Presence is instituted for all time.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, I believe in Your true Presence in the Eucharist.
colloquy: Lord, on the night before You suffered, You left us this Sacrament of love.
  I adore Your gift of Yourself under the humble signs of bread and wine.
resolution: I will make a reverent sign of the cross today when passing a Catholic church, honoring Christ present in the tabernacle.
