  Sinai thunder and cloud — The mountain shakes, clothed in fire and smoke.
  Lightning flashes. A trumpet sounds. The people tremble as the voice of God roars
  from the cloud.

meditative_points:
  - Fear of the Lord includes judgment — not just final, but present. Every action echoes in eternity.
  - "Reverence flows from judgment: If God sees all, then I must walk carefully and speak with grace."
  - Reverence isn't stiffness—it’s interior awareness of being always before God’s face.
ejaculatory_prayer: Lord, may I never forget that You see all.
colloquy: Lord, make me mindful of judgment—not to paralyze me, but to purify my walk. Let reverence be the clothing of my soul.
resolution: "I will pause before speaking today and ask: would I say this in God's presence?"
