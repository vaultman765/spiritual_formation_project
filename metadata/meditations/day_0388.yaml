meditative_points:
  - God grants you “precious and very great promises” so that you may partake of His divine nature.
  - "This participation is real: grace deifies without destroying, making you truly God’s child."
  - Growth in virtue — faith, knowledge, love — is the path of this transformation.
ejaculatory_prayer: O Lord, make me a sharer in Your divine life.
colloquy: Father, what is mine by nature is weakness, but You give me what is Yours by grace.
  Let me live as a true participant in Your nature through Christ.
resolution: I will practice one concrete virtue today — patience, charity, or self-control — as a step in sharing God’s life.
