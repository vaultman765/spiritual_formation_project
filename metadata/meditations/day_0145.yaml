meditative_points:
  - “Well done, good and faithful servant.” Christ’s voice is full of joy. The soul is welcomed, not as a stranger, but as a friend.
  - The doors of the kingdom open. Light pours forth. The soul’s long exile is ended.
  - The joy of Christ is shared with the saints — heaven is communion, not solitude.

colloquy: Give thanks to Christ for every grace received and every cross carried. Ask to persevere in love until the end.
resolution: Today I will do one hidden work of love, offering it for the grace of final perseverance.
