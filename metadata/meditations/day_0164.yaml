meditative_points:
  - "Hear God’s promise to Abraham: “So shall your descendants be,” as he gazes at the countless stars."
  - Watch Abraham’s face, torn between hope and impossibility, as he believes against all odds.
  - Stand quietly in the desert beside him, feeling the weight of hope in God’s word.
ejaculatory_prayer: God of Abraham, strengthen my trust in Your promises.
colloquy: Speak to the Lord about the promises you struggle to believe, and ask for the faith to hope against hope.
resolution: Today, I will recall a time God was faithful in the past, and let it renew my trust.
