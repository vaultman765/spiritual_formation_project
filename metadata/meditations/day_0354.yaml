meditative_points:
  - “Whatever you ask the Father in my name, He will give it to you” - the promise of Christ Himself.
  - His Name is not a formula, but the living presence of His Person.
  - Hold the Name in prayer as a child clings to a father, confident of being heard.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, I trust in the power of Your Holy Name.
colloquy: Lord, teach me to pray in Your Name with faith and simplicity.
  May my petitions be united to Your will, confident that the Father hears me.
resolution: Today I will end all my prayers explicitly “through Jesus Christ our Lord,” focusing on His Name with devotion.
