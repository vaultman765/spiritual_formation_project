day_title: Water from the Side of Christ, Wash Me
anchor_image: You see the soldier pierce His side. Blood and water gush out together.
  You realize this is not just a sign — it is the fountain of life, baptism, cleansing,
  and rebirth. You reach toward it.

meditative_points:
  - Watch as the water pours from His side, pure and cleansing.
  - "Hear the Church say: 'From His side flowed the fountain of Baptism.'"
  - Ask to be washed again — not in symbol, but in Spirit — by this water that still
    flows for you.
ejaculatory_prayer: Water from the side of Christ, cleanse me.
colloquy: Speak to Jesus about your desire to be washed of hidden sins. Thank Him
  for the Sacrament of Baptism. Ask to renew your vows of purity and belonging.
resolution: I will renew my baptismal promises today in prayer and reject sin’s grip
  anew.
