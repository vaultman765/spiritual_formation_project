anchor_image:
  A holy monk lies dying peacefully in his cell, his hands folded over
  his chest. Candlelight flickers, casting warm shadows on the faces of the other
  monks kneeling around him in silent prayer. There is no fear — only serenity. We
  are there, kneeling beside the bed.

meditative_points:
  - "‘The just man, though he die early, shall be at rest.’"
  - He dies unknown to the world — but known to You. Your Word says his soul was pleasing
    to You, and You hastened him away lest evil corrupt him. Let me see death through
    Your eyes.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, remember me in the hour of my death.
colloquy:
  Speak to Christ as one who longs to die in His grace. Ask Him to make your
  soul ready — not later, but now. Thank Him for those unknown saints whose holy deaths
  prepare the way for your own.
resolution:
  Today I will spend one moment in silence, imagining the moment of my death
  — and offer my life to God anew.
