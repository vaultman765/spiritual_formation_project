  - "“Every scribe trained for the Kingdom… brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.”"
  - "Stand at the storeroom door: Law and Gospel together, fulfilled in Christ."
  - Receive the unity—Christ as the key to all Scripture.

  ardent for the new in You. Teach me to read all things in Your light.
