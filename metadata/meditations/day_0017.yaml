  Sinai thunder and cloud — The mountain shakes, clothed in fire and smoke.
  Lightning flashes. A trumpet sounds. The people tremble as the voice of God roars
  from the cloud.

meditative_points:
  - The fear of the Lord is not only a disposition—it is a **gift of the Holy Spirit**. It is infused, not achieved,
    and grows as we draw closer to God.
  - This fear keeps us from sin—not only because of punishment, but because we dread offending the One we love.
  - The saints feared sin more than suffering. This fear purifies love.
ejaculatory_prayer: Spirit of God, give me the gift of holy fear
colloquy: Holy Spirit, inflame in me Your gift of holy fear. Teach me to recoil not from pain, but from sin.
resolution:
  I will examine my conscience today in the light of holy fear — not shame,
  but awe that leads to repentance.
