meditative_points:
  - Imagine the silence of Nazareth by night — only the breath of those asleep and the faint creak of wood.
  - See the young Jesus kneeling in prayer, His heart lifted in silence to the Father.
  - Let the night silence remind you of prayer that rises unseen, hidden yet precious to God.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, quiet my soul in the silence of night.
colloquy: Lord, in the hush of Nazareth, You prayed unseen. Teach me to love hidden prayer, known only to You.
resolution: Before bed, I will pause for two minutes of silent prayer, letting the night become an offering to God.
