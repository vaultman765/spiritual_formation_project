meditative_points:
  - Look upon Christ’s hands nailed to the wood, bearing the pain of every sin.
  - Consider how those hands healed, blessed, and broke bread; now they are pierced for love.
  - Ask that your own works be sanctified through His wounded hands.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, sanctify my works through Your holy hands.
colloquy: Lord, my hands so often act selfishly. Pierce them with Your love, that I may serve others as You did.
resolution: I will do one act of service today consciously in union with Christ’s pierced hands.
