day_title: Love Is Sacrificial Service
anchor_image: Christ washing the disciples’ feet — The Son of God kneels in the dust.
  He touches dirt and fatigue, pouring water not only onto their feet, but into their
  shame. This is love made visible in humility.

meditative_points:
  - “If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet…” (Jn 13:14) — Christ does
    not lower Himself despite His glory — but because of it.
  - Love does not cling to rights. It pours itself out like water in a basin.
  - The Catechism calls this love “the form of all the virtues” (CCC 1825) — it gives
    life to every act.
ejaculatory_prayer: Let me love by lowering myself.
colloquy: Jesus, I want to follow You — but I fear the basin and the towel. Give me
  the joy of sacrificial love, not in words but in humble acts.
resolution: Today I will choose a task I usually avoid — and do it with reverence.
