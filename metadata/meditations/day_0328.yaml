meditative_points:
  - “Like a lamb led to the slaughter, He opened not His mouth.” Even in the home, Christ obeys in silence.
  - Watch Him perform tasks without resistance, embodying peace in submission.
  - Let your heart be taught that true obedience is quiet trust, not argument or delay.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, teach me silent obedience.
colloquy: Lord, I resist so often in words or excuses.
  Give me Your grace to be silent in obedience, and to trust that the Father sees my surrender.
resolution: I will accept one hidden task today without complaint or explanation, doing it in silence for love of Christ.
