anchor_image: You stand before Christ on the mount as He proclaims the Beatitudes.

  both your weakness and His promise of the Kingdom.

meditative_points:
  - Christ blesses not the materially rich but the poor in spirit — those who know their need for God.
  - Poverty of spirit is humility — a heart emptied of pride, ready for divine filling.
  - Ask for the grace to embrace this poverty as the gate to the Kingdom, not a loss but a divine inheritance.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, make my heart poor and open to Your Kingdom.
colloquy: Speak to Christ as you stand among the crowd on the mount. Thank Him for blessing your poverty and for promising
  you the Kingdom. Ask Him to strip you of pride and fill you with His Spirit.
resolution: Today I will make a small act of humility — accepting correction, resisting self-justification, or thanking God for weakness.
