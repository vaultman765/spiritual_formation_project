anchor_image: The great golden statue towers over the plain of Dura, surrounded by officials and the gathered crowd.
  Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego stand alone, refusing to bow as the music plays. The furious king orders
  the blazing furnace to be heated seven times hotter. The young men, bound and dressed in their finest garments,
  are thrown into the fire. The flames roar, but in the midst of the furnace, an angel appears—there is peace where
  death was expected. The astonished king sees four figures walking unharmed in the fire, the angel shining with
  divine light. The crowd watches in awe as the three faithful emerge untouched, proclaiming the power of the true God.
