meditative_points:
  - "Hear Christ say: “I am the way, and the truth, and the life” — not a path, but a Person."
  - See the disciples troubled and fearful, and Christ consoling them with His promise.
  - Recognize that the narrow way is to remain in Him who is Himself the path to the Father.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, be my Way, my Truth, my Life.
colloquy: Lord, I cannot walk the narrow road by myself. Be my strength and my guide, leading me safely to the Father.
resolution: I will recite slowly the words “I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life” during the day, letting them shape my choices.
