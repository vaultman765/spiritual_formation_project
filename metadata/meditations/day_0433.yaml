day_title: Bildad’s Verdict — The Fate of the Wicked
anchor_image: You sit on the ash heap beside Job as Bildad steps forward again.
  The wind lifts the dust; his voice is sharp, describing the downfall of the wicked as if pointing at Job.
  You feel the sting of words spoken without knowing a man’s heart.

meditative_points:
  - Bildad’s images of darkness closing in, the lamp of the wicked snuffed out, echo through the ruin where you sit with Job.
  - The distance between human verdicts and God’s hidden knowledge presses on the heart.
  - Job’s silent endurance speaks more truly than the many words that condemn him.
ejaculatory_prayer: “Lord, you alone know the heart; shelter me in your justice.”
colloquy: Lord, I feel the weight of judgments—others’ and my own. You see what men cannot.
  Teach me to bear misunderstanding without bitterness, and to wait for your light.
resolution: Refrain today from speaking a negative judgment about anyone; instead, pray a brief blessing for the person in silence.
