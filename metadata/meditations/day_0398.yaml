meditative_points:
  - “I forgave you all that debt… should not you have had mercy on your fellow servant?”
  - Look at the two debts side by side; feel the measureless mercy first received.
  - Let the King’s mercy become your rule toward the smallest offense.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, merciful King, make my heart merciful.
colloquy: Lord, I owe You everything. Break my hard judgments; teach me to forgive as I have been forgiven.
resolution: I will name one person and make a concrete step toward reconciliation or intercede for them by name today.
