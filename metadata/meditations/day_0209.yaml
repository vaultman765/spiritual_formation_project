day_title: The Sorrowful Mother
anchor_image: You are standing with Mary at the foot of the Cross. She gazes upon her Son in agony, hears His words,
  and unites her heart to His sacrifice. John is beside her, and the soldiers are near. Simeon’s prophecy — that a
  sword would pierce her soul — is now fulfilled.

meditative_points:
  - Behold Mary as Mater Dolorosa, her soul pierced by sorrow yet unshaken in faith.
  - Let her tears move your heart — sorrow flowing from love for her crucified Son.
  - "See her sorrow as fruitful: her pain borne for the salvation of the world."
ejaculatory_prayer: O Mary, sorrowful Mother, pray for me.
colloquy: Mother, your sorrow pierces my heart. Let me not be indifferent to the Cross, but weep with you and love Jesus with your love.
resolution: I will pray the Stabat Mater slowly today, uniting my heart to Mary’s sorrow.
