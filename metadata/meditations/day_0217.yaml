anchor_image: "You are with the disciples after many have walked away from Jesus’ hard teaching.
  He turns and asks, “Will you also go away?” Peter responds: “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life.”
  You remain in adoration before the mystery of His Presence."

meditative_points:
  - Hear the crowd murmur and depart, unable to accept Christ’s words.
  - "Stay with Peter, confessing faith even in mystery: “You have the words of eternal life.”"
  - Adore what senses cannot grasp — the mystery of Christ hidden under the Eucharistic species.
ejaculatory_prayer: Lord, I believe; help my unbelief.
colloquy: Jesus, though veiled in mystery, You are truly here. Strengthen my faith, that I may adore You always with love and reverence.
resolution: I will make a brief visit to the Blessed Sacrament today, adoring Christ hidden yet truly present.
