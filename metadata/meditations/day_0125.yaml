meditative_points:
  - He was subject to them. God made flesh, obeying His creatures.
  - He lowers His eyes when spoken to. There is no resistance in Him.
  - The silence of Nazareth is filled with the obedience of God.
ejaculatory_prayer:
  Jesus, obedient Son of Mary, make my heart meek and lowly like
  Yours.
colloquy:
  Lord Jesus, how can I understand this mystery? That You, the Eternal Word,
  chose to obey Your own Mother, to submit to the care of Joseph, to hide Yourself
  in a village no one would praise. Teach me this obedience. Root out my pride. Let
  me be content to be hidden with You.
resolution:
  I will obey promptly in one small task today — as an offering to the Hidden
  Christ.
