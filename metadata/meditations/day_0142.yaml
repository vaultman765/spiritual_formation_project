meditative_points:
  - “Come, you blessed of my Father…” Christ’s words are joy — the reward of secret mercy, now made public.
  - “Depart from me…” The voice is just, not cruel. Separation is not random; it is truth revealed in love.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, make me worthy to stand at Your right hand.
colloquy: Stand with Christ among the sheep. Ask for a heart like His — merciful, truthful, ready to embrace the lost.
resolution: Today I will forgive a hidden hurt or serve someone in need, preparing for my own judgment with mercy.
