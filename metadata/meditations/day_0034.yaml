anchor_image:
  '**The Crucifixion** Jesus is nailed to the wood. The Cross is raised. He hangs in silence between earth and heaven.
  "Father, forgive them," He says. The sky darkens. He thirsts. He gives His mother to John. Love is poured out as blood.'

meditative_points:
  - Christ speaks few words — but every one is infinite.
  - He forgives — even while the nails are still in His hands.
  - He dies — and opens Heaven.
ejaculatory_prayer: Crucified Jesus, remember me in Your mercy.
colloquy: 'Jesus, You were lifted up so that I might rise.
  Teach me not just to mourn You, but to receive the love You poured out at Calvary.'
resolution: I will pray the Divine Mercy Chaplet today, slowly and with reverence, kneeling if possible.
