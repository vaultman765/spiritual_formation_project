  - Christ prays that His disciples may share in the unity of the Father and the Son.
  - "The glory given Him is now given to you: participation in divine communion."
  - The Trinity’s own love is not only revealed but shared with the soul.
ejaculatory_prayer: Father, may I be one in You through Your Son.
colloquy: Lord Jesus, draw me into the mystery You revealed — the Father in You and You in the Father.
  Let me live within this unity by Your Spirit.
resolution: I will pray for unity in the Church today, uniting my petition with Christ’s high priestly prayer.
