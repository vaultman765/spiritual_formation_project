meditative_points:
  - Hear Jesus say, “Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You.”
  - Sense the weight of this hour — the whole mission reaching its climax in self-offering.
  - Behold His glory revealed not in triumph, but in obedience unto the Cross.
ejaculatory_prayer: Father, glorify Your Son in me.
colloquy: Lord Jesus, You offered Yourself entirely to glorify the Father. Teach me to live for His glory in all things.
resolution: I will begin and end today with the Sign of the Cross, uniting my actions to the glory of the Father through Christ.
