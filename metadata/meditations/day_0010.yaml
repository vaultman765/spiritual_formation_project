anchor_image:
  Christ washing the disciples’ feet — The Son of God kneels in the dust.
  He touches dirt and fatigue, pouring water not only onto their feet, but into their
  shame. This is love made visible in humility.

meditative_points:
  - “You also ought to wash one another’s feet.” (Jn 13:14) — He said this after washing
    the feet of Judas.
  - “Love your enemies… and pray for those who persecute you.” (Mt 5:44) — To love an
    enemy does not mean to feel warmth — it means to will their sanctity.
  - “If you love those who love you, what reward do you have?” (Mt 5:46)
ejaculatory_prayer: Lord, give me the strength to love those who do not love me.
colloquy:
  Jesus, You knew Judas would betray You — yet You served him with tenderness.
  Teach me how to kneel before those I fear. Teach me how to pray for those who wound.
resolution: Today I will silently bless or intercede for someone I resist in my heart.
