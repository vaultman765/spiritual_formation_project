meditative_points:
  - "Jesus turns to me and says: ‘Seek first the kingdom…’ — not as advice, but as command."
  - All that I need is added when I surrender the illusion of needing anything more
    than God.
ejaculatory_prayer: Lord, let me long for Your kingdom above all else.
colloquy:
  O Jesus, make my heart simple. I seek so many things that cannot satisfy.
  Reorder my desires. Let my life be drawn toward You as its center. Teach me to live
  for the Father's will, trusting all else to His hand.
resolution: I will simplify one part of my day today to focus entirely on God.
