  Sinai thunder and cloud — The mountain shakes, clothed in fire and smoke.
  Lightning flashes. A trumpet sounds. The people tremble as the voice of God roars
  from the cloud.

meditative_points:
  - At Sinai, the people saw thunder, lightning, smoke—and trembled (Exodus 20:18).
  - Fear of the Lord includes physical, emotional, and spiritual trembling—not terror, but reverent stillness before the One who *is*.
ejaculatory_prayer: Holy God, I tremble before Your majesty.
colloquy: Lord, restore to me a trembling heart. Let me never treat You lightly or forget Your majesty. Let holy fear make my love more real.
resolution: I will enter church or my prayer space today in silence, with head bowed and heart stilled, like Israel before Sinai.
