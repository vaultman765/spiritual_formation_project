meditative_points:
  - Watch Jesus take the bread, bless it, and break it — and see the disciples’ eyes opened in recognition.
  - Feel your own heart burn as He makes Himself known in Word and Sacrament.
  - Recognize that He vanishes from sight so that you may cling to Him in the Eucharist.
ejaculatory_prayer: Lord Jesus, stay with me, for it is evening.
colloquy: Jesus, You reveal Yourself in the breaking of bread. Do not let my eyes be blind to Your Presence in the Eucharist.
resolution: I will read today’s Gospel attentively, asking Christ to open my eyes to recognize Him more clearly in the Eucharist.
