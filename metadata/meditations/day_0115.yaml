meditative_points:
  - "Christ speaks directly to you: “Blessed are the pure in heart…” —
    Promising a vision of God, not to the clever, but to the clean."
  - The counsel of chastity is the way of those who live for Love alone.
ejaculatory_prayer: Lord, purify my heart that I may see You.
colloquy:
  Jesus, my heart is restless until it rests in You. Cleanse me of all false
  loves, all unworthy desires. Make my heart a clear window to behold You and to reflect
  You.
resolution:
  Today I will guard my eyes, thoughts, and affections in love for Christ’s
  purity.
