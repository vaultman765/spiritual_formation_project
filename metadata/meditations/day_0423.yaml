meditative_points:
  - "The hymn swells: “Bless the Lord… forever.” Hear heaven answer—the elders fall down, and every creature cries “Amen.”"
  - "See time itself yield to praise: morning and evening, trial and triumph—all gathered into one Alleluia."
  - Taste the joy of belonging to a worship that never ends, already begun in your heart.
ejaculatory_prayer: To You be blessing and glory forever.
colloquy: Lamb of God, draw me into the worship of heaven. Let my life become a quiet “Amen” that never ceases.
resolution: I will end today with a brief doxology (“Glory be…”) prayed slowly, uniting my voice to the worship of heaven and earth.
