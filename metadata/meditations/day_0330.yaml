anchor_image: You are in Nazareth. The young Jesus bows His head in obedience as
  Mary gives Him a simple task. Joseph looks on with quiet approval. The eternal
  Word submits Himself in humility within this hidden home.

meditative_points:
  - “Although He was a Son, He learned obedience through what He suffered.” Nazareth was His school of the Cross.
  - See Him obey in small things, each act preparing Him for the obedience of Calvary.
  - Ponder that your daily obediences, too, prepare you to carry your cross with Him.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, make me obedient unto the Cross.
colloquy: Lord, unite my small obediences with Yours in Nazareth, that I may be ready to follow You in greater trials.
  May obedience form me for the Cross.
resolution: I will accept one small difficulty today without complaint, offering it in union with Christ’s obedience.
