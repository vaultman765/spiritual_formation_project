meditative_points:
  - "Mary’s littleness becomes her greatness: God exalts the humble who make room for Him."
  - Francis de Sales teaches that holiness is found in small, daily acts done with humility.
  - Spiritual childhood rejoices to be little, so that God’s greatness may shine forth.
ejaculatory_prayer: O Lord, make me small, that You may be great.
colloquy: Mary, teach me your song of humility. Lord, let me find joy in being little, in letting You be my strength and glory.
resolution: I will offer a hidden act of charity today, desiring no recognition but God’s alone.
