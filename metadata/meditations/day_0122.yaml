meditative_points:
  - "For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."
  - Heaven is not far — it begins when I choose the eternal over the passing.
  - The things I cling to most may be the very things God asks me to offer Him.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, be my only treasure.
colloquy:
  Lord, I gather many things — comfort, plans, reputation — and call them
  security. But You show me that only what is stored in love lasts. Detach my heart
  from what fades. Make me rich in You alone.
resolution:
  I will spend five minutes today examining what I treasure — and consciously
  give it to God.
