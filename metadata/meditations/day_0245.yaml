meditative_points:
  - Walk with the disciples on the road to Emmaus as their hearts burn when Christ opens the Scriptures.
  - "Hear the Lord say as if saying to me: “O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe…”"
  - Realize that the Spirit grants you interior light to penetrate the mysteries of faith beyond words.
ejaculatory_prayer: Holy Spirit, open the eyes of my heart.
colloquy: Lord, grant me the gift of understanding, that I may see more deeply into Your mysteries and not remain blind to Your presence.
resolution: I will spend a few moments today rereading a familiar Scripture, asking the Spirit to show me a deeper meaning.
