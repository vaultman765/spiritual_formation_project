meditative_points:
  - "Hear the sting of Eliphaz’s second charge and the deeper counter-cry: “Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven.”"
  - Stand within Job’s solitude as earthly allies fail and only the unseen Witness remains.
  - Let the word “Advocate” ripen in the darkness—prayer stretching toward a faithful Presence.
ejaculatory_prayer: O heavenly Witness, remember me.
colloquy: Lord, when human counsel cannot reach me, be my Counselor. When no one understands, be my Witness and Friend.
resolution: Bring one hidden anxiety to God alone tonight; entrust it explicitly to His keeping before sleep.
