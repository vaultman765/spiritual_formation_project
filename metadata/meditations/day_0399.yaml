anchor_image: You stand on the shore of the Sea of Galilee. Jesus is a short distance offshore in a boat, teaching the crowd.
  The water carries His voice; the sun is high; the press of people quiets as He begins to speak.

meditative_points:
  - “Am I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me?” Hear the Master’s freedom in giving.
  - “The last will be first, and the first last.” Stand under the reversal of grace.
  - Envy fades before gratuity—His generosity, not your wages, measures the Kingdom.
ejaculatory_prayer: Lord, let Your generosity rule my heart.
colloquy: Jesus, my merits are nothing—Your grace is everything. Free me from envy and comparison; make me rejoice in every gift You give.
resolution: I will thank God today for a grace given to someone else, naming it without comparison.
