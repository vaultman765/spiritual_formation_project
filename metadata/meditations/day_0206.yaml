day_title: “Woman, Behold Your Son”
anchor_image: You are standing with Mary at the foot of the Cross. She gazes upon her Son in agony, hears His words,
  and unites her heart to His sacrifice. John is beside her, and the soldiers are near. Simeon’s prophecy — that a
  sword would pierce her soul — is now fulfilled.

meditative_points:
  - "Hear Christ’s words: “Woman, behold your son.” He entrusts John — and you — to Mary."
  - See her eyes turn from her crucified Son to you, accepting you with maternal love.
  - Realize that in this gift of motherhood, Mary suffers and loves at once — her heart stretched wide for the Church.
ejaculatory_prayer: Mary, be my Mother at the Cross.
colloquy: Jesus, thank You for giving me Your Mother. Mary, receive me as your child, that I may remain faithful at the Cross with you.
resolution: I will entrust myself explicitly to Mary today, praying the Memorare as an act of filial confidence.
