  '**Christ Revealing His Sacred Heart in Glory** — You kneel before the risen Christ. His eyes are like fire and mercy.
  His hands are extended in blessing, and His robe gleams like light.
  But what draws your soul is His Heart — visible, radiant, pierced, encircled with thorns, and burning with love.
  It is not a wound of shame, but a throne of glory. He says nothing.
  He simply shows you the place where divine love became visible. Each title of the Litany is real here.
  You gaze at the Heart… and see eternity.'

meditative_points:
  - The Lamb standing as though slain — praised by all creation
  - The Sacred Heart as the center of heaven’s liturgy
ejaculatory_prayer: Heart of Jesus, slain and glorified, receive my praise with the worship of heaven.
colloquy:
  'Heart of Jesus, You are not praised because You need it — but because You deserve it.
  Let every fiber of my being join the saints and angels in declaring: You alone are worthy.'
resolution: Today I will pause at least once and praise Jesus aloud — even if no one sees — simply because He is worthy.
