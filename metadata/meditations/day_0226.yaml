meditative_points:
  - See the first disciples sharing all things in common and devoting themselves to the breaking of bread.
  - Recognize the narrow way is not walked alone — it is the path of the Church.
  - "Learn from Benedict’s call: “Let us run on the path of God’s commandments,
    our hearts overflowing with the inexpressible delight of love.”"
ejaculatory_prayer: Lord, keep me faithful in the communion of Your Church.
colloquy: Jesus, thank You for companions in the faith. Preserve me in the unity of Your Body as we walk the road together.
resolution: I will perform an act of charity today for a fellow believer, remembering we walk the narrow way together.
