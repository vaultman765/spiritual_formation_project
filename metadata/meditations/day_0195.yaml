  life, and mystery poured out for your soul.

meditative_points:
  - Let your eyes rest on the Blood flowing from His side.
  - "Hear Him say: 'My Blood is drink indeed.' Do you thirst for it?"
  - Pray that your soul may be inebriated — filled, overtaken — with His love alone.
ejaculatory_prayer: Precious Blood of Jesus, flood my soul.
colloquy: Tell Jesus your desire to be drunk only with His love — not with the world’s
  false consolations. Ask Him to let His Blood penetrate the dry places of your soul.
resolution: I will renounce one worldly pleasure today to let Christ’s Blood be my
  joy.
