meditative_points:
  - There is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.
  - See the Apostles proclaiming the Name of Jesus with courage, unafraid before rulers.
  - Trust in the saving power of this Name, calling upon it in temptation and fear.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, Savior of all, save me.
colloquy: Lord, I profess that Your Name alone holds the power to rescue me. Write it on my heart forever.
resolution: I will call on the Name of Jesus at least once today in a moment of weakness or trial.
