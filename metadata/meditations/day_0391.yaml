meditative_points:
  - "“The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed.” See the field stretch out in evening light."
  - "While men sleep, weeds appear — wheat and tares grow side by side, similar in stalk and leaf."
  - "Hear the Master: “Let both grow together until the harvest.” The sickle and fire belong to the end."
ejaculatory_prayer: Lord, keep me faithful while the field ripens.
colloquy: Master, Your patience is wisdom. Keep me from rash judgment;
  make me steadfast among mixed growth, looking to Your harvest and Your justice.
resolution: I will refrain from one critical word today and instead pray one Hail Mary for the person I would have judged.
