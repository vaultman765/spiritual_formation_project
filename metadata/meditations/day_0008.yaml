  Christ washing the disciples’ feet — The Son of God kneels in the dust.
  He touches dirt and fatigue, pouring water not only onto their feet, but into their
  shame. This is love made visible in humility.

meditative_points:
  - “He rose from supper, laid aside His garments, and tied a towel around Himself.”
    (Jn 13:4) — The Lord of the universe strips Himself for service.
  - “Then He poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet…” (Jn 13:5)
    — Christ touches what others avoid — dirt, fatigue, shame.
  - “I have given you an example…” (Jn 13:15)
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, give me Your basin and towel.
colloquy:
  Jesus, You bend lower than I deserve. Let me not hesitate to kneel for others.
  Let me become someone who sees, stoops, and loves.
resolution: Today I will serve someone personally, with no expectation of being seen.
