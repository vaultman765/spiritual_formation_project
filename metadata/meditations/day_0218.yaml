  St. John Vianney, St. Peter Julian Eymard, St. Thérèse, and countless others. Their lives are aflame because they live
  from the Eucharist."

meditative_points:
  - "Hear Christ’s words: “Abide in me, and I in you” — fulfilled in the Eucharist."
  - See the saints transformed by daily Communion and hours before the tabernacle.
  - Recognize that the Eucharist is the secret fire of holiness, the fountain of mission.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, abide in me as I abide in You.
colloquy: Lord, You have sanctified countless saints by the Eucharist.
  Make me thirst for this Sacrament and conform my life to Yours through it.
resolution: I will read or recall a short testimony of a saint devoted to the Eucharist and imitate one small practice of theirs today.
