anchor_image:
  "The soul stands on the threshold, hearing the words of Christ: “Depart from Me.”
  The face of Christ is sorrowful but just. The soul turns away, feeling the finality
  of separation."

meditative_points:
  - “Depart from Me, you workers of iniquity.” The door closes. Christ’s sorrow is greater than the soul’s.
  - The soul remembers every grace rejected. Silence fills the darkness beyond the gate.
  - The Judge weeps for the lost — mercy offered, mercy refused.
ejaculatory_prayer: Lord, save me from that sentence; let me hear only Your welcome.
colloquy: Ask Christ for the grace of true repentance and perseverance, that you may never be separated from Him.
resolution: Today I will accept a hidden correction or penance with humility, seeking union with Christ over comfort.
