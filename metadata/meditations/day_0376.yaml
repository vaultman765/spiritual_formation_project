meditative_points:
  - The Lord is like a refiner’s fire, purifying His people as silver.
  - Purification is painful but ordered to beauty and holiness.
  - The Spirit does not destroy - He transforms until God’s likeness shines.

colloquy: Lord, I bring You what is mixed and impure in me.
  Consume the dross of sin; leave only what is Yours, radiant and ready for service.
