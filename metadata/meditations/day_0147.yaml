day_title: The Blood Accepted — Gethsemane and the Chalice
anchor_image: Christ kneeling in the Garden of Gethsemane under the ancient olive trees.
  The night is heavy and silent. Sweat falls from His face like drops of blood,
  and an angel stands near Him, holding a chalice of suffering and consolation.
  In the distance, the torches of those coming to arrest Him flicker in the darkness.

meditative_points:
  - Remain beside Christ in His solitude and anguish.
    Watch as He accepts the Father’s will, embracing the chalice that contains every sin and sorrow.
  - Sense the weight of your own sins that He takes upon Himself, and the silent, willing offering of
    His Precious Blood for you.
ejaculatory_prayer: Jesus, in Your agony, may Your Precious Blood strengthen me to accept the Father’s will.
colloquy: Speak to Jesus in His suffering. Tell Him you wish to be near Him in Gethsemane, to watch and pray with Him,
  and to receive the strength to accept God’s will even when it costs dearly.
resolution: Today, I will accept a small suffering or act of obedience in union with Christ’s agony in Gethsemane.
