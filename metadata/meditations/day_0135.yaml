anchor_image:
  A beautiful palace stands in ruin. Cobwebs cover the once-glorious hall.
  A golden crown lies in the dust. We walk through the decay, seeing what time does
  to power and pleasure.

meditative_points:
  - The body declines, the pleasures fade, the world forgets. Nothing endures but grace.
  - ‘Vanity of vanities’ — Solomon saw it all and called it empty.
ejaculatory_prayer: Let me desire only what lasts, O Lord.
colloquy:
  Speak to God from the ruins. Offer Him whatever worldly thing still holds
  your heart. Ask Him to give you holy indifference to all that passes away.
resolution:
  Today I will detach from one small worldly indulgence — and offer it to
  God.
