    - The Crucified Christ (Face) — You gaze upon the face of Christ crucified. His
      eyes are closed, His head bowed beneath the crown of thorns. From this suffering
      Face shines infinite love. Every wound speaks the truth of God’s heart.

    - Christ washing the disciples’ feet — The Son of God kneels in the dust. He touches
      dirt and fatigue, pouring water not only onto their feet, but into their shame.
      This is love made visible in humility.

    - "**The Divine Physician Finds the Lost Sheep** — You see yourself wounded and
      alone, far from the flock. Christ appears—not with reproach, but with urgency.
      He kneels beside you, binding your wounds with gentleness. He lifts you onto His
      shoulders. You feel the weight of your sin, but also the warmth of His mercy."
    - "**The Embrace of Peace** — You are held in the Father’s arms. There is no accusation,
      no shame, only stillness. His breath is gentle against your shoulder. You do not
      speak. You simply rest, forgiven and beloved."
    - "**The Interior Battle** — You are in a dark room with two voices speaking from
      either side: one of accusation, the other of hope. Your hands are bound, but your
      heart stirs. You cry out for freedom, even as the chains tighten. Christ stands
      silently before you, holding the key. He waits for your plea."
    - "**The Kneeling Soul** — You kneel in a dimly lit confessional. A curtain veils
      the priest, but through it speaks the mercy of Christ. You whisper your sins into
      the silence, and from beyond the veil comes a voice: 'Go in peace.'"
    - "**The Light That Reveals** — You are in a room lit only by candlelight. Christ
      opens the door, and radiant light floods in. You see the dust, the stains, the
      wounds — things hidden in the half-light are now exposed. But He does not turn
      away. He looks with truth and love, not accusation."
    - "**The Path Beyond the Gate** — You walk through a field where the confessional
      once stood. The breeze is gentle, the sky clear. Yet behind you lies shadow, and
      ahead the road bends sharply. You know now what must be guarded."
    - "**The Road Home** — You walk a long dirt path alone, torn and stained by your
      sins. In the distance, the Father waits — not seated, but running. His arms are
      open before you even speak. He throws His cloak over your shame and calls for
      a feast."

    - "**Christ Bound and Tried** Judas kisses Him in the garden. Guards seize Him.
      He is dragged before the high priest. You see false witnesses, spittle, blows.
      Peter warms himself by the fire outside. A rooster crows. Jesus remains silent."
    - "**Christ Crowned with Thorns** Jesus is seated, hands bound, draped in a purple
      robe. A crown of twisted thorns is pressed onto His head. Blood trickles down
      His face. A reed is shoved into His hand like a mock scepter. Soldiers jeer and
      bow in sarcasm. Yet He radiates quiet majesty in their mockery."
    - '**Christ in Gethsemane** Christ kneels beneath twisted olive trees. His face
      is pressed to the earth, streaked with sweat and blood. The chalice of suffering
      looms before Him. The disciples sleep nearby. The moonlight casts long shadows
      as He whispers, "Not My will, but Yours be done."'
    - '**Mary at the Foot of the Cross** Mary stands beneath the Cross, silent. Her
      Son hangs above her. She does not cry aloud — her sorrow is still, total, unresisting.
      John is beside her. Christ says, "Behold your mother." She receives the Church
      into her heart.'
    - "**The Burial of Christ** The body of Jesus is taken down. Nicodemus and Joseph
      of Arimathea wrap Him in linen, anoint Him with myrrh. Mary touches His face one
      last time. The tomb is near. They roll the stone across the entrance. Stillness
      covers everything."
    - "**The Crucifixion** Jesus is nailed to the wood. The Cross is raised. He hangs
      in silence between earth and heaven. “Father, forgive them,” He says. The sky
      darkens. He thirsts. He gives His mother to John. Love is poured out as blood."
    - '**The Final Surrender** Jesus breathes His last. "Father, into Your hands I commend
      My spirit." The veil of the Temple is torn. The earth trembles. Those who stood
      near beat their breasts. The centurion says, "Truly this man was the Son of God."'
    - "**The Piercing of His Side** The sky has gone still. Christ’s body hangs lifeless.
      A soldier steps forward and thrusts a spear into His side. Blood and water pour
      out — not just fluid, but the birth of the Church. Mary sees it all. The silence
      deepens."
    - "**The Scourging at the Pillar** Stripped and bound, Jesus stands at the pillar.
      The whip cracks. His back tears open. Blood runs down the stone floor. The guards
      mock, but He does not resist. The Lamb is prepared for sacrifice."

    - "**Christ Revealing His Sacred Heart in Glory** — You kneel before the risen Christ.
      His eyes are like fire and mercy. His hands are extended in blessing, and His
      robe gleams like light. But what draws your soul is His Heart — visible, radiant,
      pierced, encircled with thorns, and burning with love. It is not a wound of shame,
      but a throne of glory. He says nothing. He simply shows you the place where divine
      love became visible. Each title of the Litany is real here. You gaze at the Heart…
      and see eternity."
